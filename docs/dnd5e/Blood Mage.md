- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- Leather armor, and two daggers

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 4d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Blood Magic
Your research into the power of blood have given you the power to harness this energy to cast spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know the [[dnd5e/Spell/Blood Lance\|Blood Lance]] cantrip and 2 other cantrips of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Blood Mage\|Blood Mage spell list]]. You learn additional Blood Mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Blood Mage table.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Blood Mage\|Blood Mage spell list]].

The Spells Known column of the Blood Mage table shows when you learn more blood mage spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Max Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new blood mage spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the blood mage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Blood Mage\|Blood Mage spell list]], which also must be of a level for which you can cast.

#### Maximum Spell level
As your level increases, so does your power. Your Blood Mage level also determines the maximum level spells you can cast.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your blood mage spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blood mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. You also use this for powers and features gain by your blood rituals and through blood mutations.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting
You can cast any blood mage spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. However, to cast a spell as a ritual using blood magic, you must as a part of the ritual sacrifice living creatures with a combined CR value equal to or higher than the level of the spell.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your blood mage spells. Alternatively, you can use a dagger.

#### Casting a Spell of 1st level and Higher with Blood Magic
As a part of casting a spell using blood magic, you must expend a portion of your own vitality to have it work. The amount of Hit Points you lose is determined by the level of the spell cast, as shown in the table below. You cannot cast a spell if the damage from casting it would reduce you to 0 hit points or lower. Hit Points lost to blood magic always takes of your actual Hit Points, ignoring all forms of temporary Hit Points and wards.

||~ Blood Magic Price |
|Spell Level |Hit Point Cost |
|---|---|
| 1st | 4 |
| 2nd | 8 |
| 3rd | 12 |
| 4th | 16 |
| 5th | 20 |
| 6th | 25 |
| 7th | 30 |
| 8th | 35 |
| 9th | 40 |

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Cause Fear\|cause fear]], you can cast the spell by expending 4 Hit Points.

#### Casting Spells of 6th level and Higher
Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can only use blood magic to cast one spell of each level of 6th or higher. You can’t cast another spell of the same level using blood magic until you finish a long rest.

### Corruption
Whenever you expend hit points to cast a spell using blood magic, you gain an amount of corruption equal to half the amount of Hit Points spent (rounded down). Corruption is a magical sickness that lingers, reducing the effect of incoming healing magic. You can never have more corruption than your maximum hit points.

Whenever you regain Hit Points through magic, and have any corruption, an amount of corruption equal to the Hit Points received is instead removed. If this reduces the corruption to 0, any leftover Hit Point restoration works normally. IE. If you have 20 Corruption and is healed for 30 Hit Points, your corruption is reduced to 0, and you regain 10 Hit Points.

Additionally, any effect that removes a curse, removes 5d10 points of corruption on you. You also lose all corruption during a long rest, or 2d10 points of corruption during a short rest.

Hit Points regained from abilities, **but not spells**, gained through the blood mage class as well as healing from nonmagical sources ignores corruption, instead healing you directly.

Corruption is a visible phenomenon unless you make efforts to disguise it. If a creature uses its action to examine you or the faint aura eminated from having corruption, the creature can determine that you are suffering from corruption with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against a DC based on your current corruption level. Refer to the Corruption Visibility table.

|||~ Corruption Visibility |
|Corruption |Appearance |DC |
|---|---|---|
| 0-5 | Seemingly no corruption | 25 |
| 6-10 | Slight aura, your lips turn slightly purple | 20 |
| 11-20 | Purple glowing veins and paler skin | 15 |
| 21-30 | A clear aura of death, pulsing purple veins, your complexion is corpse-like | 10 |
| 31-50 | Air grows cold around you, monstrously corrupt appearance | 5 |
| 50+ | Thick dark smoke eminates from your body, nightmarish appearance | 0 |

### Blood Ritual
When you reach 2nd level, you perform a ritual, calling to the powers deep within you and focusing the energies of your blood towards a desired purpose.
- [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Beast\|Beast]]
- [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Hemocraft\|Hemocraft]]
- [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Juggernaut\|Juggernaut]]
- [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Maleficarum\|Maleficarum]]
- [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Mesmer\|Mesmer]]
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Well of Blood
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of power within your own blood. The wellspring is represented by blood points, which allows you to power abilities gained through mutations, blood rituals, or to offset the cost of using blood magic.

##### Blood Points
You have 2 blood points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Blood Points column of the Blood Mage table. You can never have more blood points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent blood points when you finish a long rest.

##### Blood Price
As a part of casting a spell using blood magic, you can also expend one blood point. Doing so reduces the Hit Point cost of the spell by 3. This may not reduce the cost of a spell below 0 hit points.

##### Blood Manipulation
As a part of casting a spell using blood magic that requires you to expend Hit Dice, you can also expend any number of blood points. Doing so reduces the Hit Dice cost of the spell by 1 for each point spent. This may not reduce the cost of a spell below 0 hit dice. If the spell requires you to roll the hit dice spent, you roll the full number of hit dice, and all hit dice not taken from your hit die pool are d12s instead.

### Blood Mutation
In your study of the power of life-force, you have uncovered how to change and alter properties of your body, granting you grander power and magical abilities.

At 3rd level, you gain two blood mutations of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Blood Mage/Mutations\|list of mutations]]. When you gain certain blood mage levels, you gain additional mutations of your choice, as shown in the Blood Mutations column of the Blood Mage table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mutations you have and replace it with another mutations that you could learn at that level

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Life Drinker
Starting at 5th level, you learn to siphon the blood of the creatures slain before you, not letting any go to waste. As a bonus action, you can designate a small or larger creature with blood that you can see within 60 feet. A faint strand of blood magic connects you and the target, and the target is aware that it is being affected by magic, but not necessarily what the source is. A creature may perform a Wisdom (Perception) check as an action against your blood mage spell DC, discerning you as the originator of the effect on a success.

Whenever the target is reduced to 0 hit points, you immediately regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus as well as reducing your current corruption by the same amount, to a minimum of 0 corruption. If you were to one to reduce the target to 0 hit points, you instead regain health equal to twice your proficiency bonus and reduce your temporary corruption by that amount.

Once you gain hit points from a creature, you cannot target the same creature for the next 24 hours.

The effect lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, you end your turn more than 60 feet from the target, the creature dies, or you end the effect as a bonus action. You can have one creature under the effect at a time, ending the effect as soon as you use this feature again.

Creatures without blood, constructs, undead, and creatures immune to charm effects are immune to this feature.

### Extended Feast
Starting at 7th level, you often find yourself surrounded by hordes of rabble and expendables. You can now have a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier targeted by your Life Drinker feature, instead of just one. If you try to affect more creatures than your limit, you must choose one of the creatures you have targeted and end the effect.

### Master Blood Mage
When you reach 20th level, you have reached the true epitome of what it means to be a blood mage. You learn to channel your magic with greater ease, and your body is strengthened to allow even greater feats of magic. You gain the following benefits.
* The Hit Point cost of all blood magic is halved (rounded down)
* You can now channel enough energy to cast two spells of each level of 6th level and higher between each long rest, instead of just one. However, the second casting of each spell level costs quadruple its normal Hit Point cost.
* Your maximum Hit Points increase by 20.
