#Orc
***Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home.***

### Orc Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1, your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score is reduced by 2.

- **Age.** Orcs reach adulthood at age 12 and live up to 50 years.

- **Alignment.** Orcs are vicious raiders, who believe that the world should be theirs. They also respect strength above all else and believe the strong must bully the weak to ensure that weakness does not spread like a disease. They are usually chaotic evil.

- **Size.** Orcs are usually over 6 feet tall and weigh between 230 and 280 pounds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Aggressive.** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

- **Menacing.** You are proficient in the Intimidation skill.

- **Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc.

#### Gray Orc
Gray Orcs are nomads. They are less bestial looking than their mountain-dwelling cousins, and have gray skin. They dwell in remote, desolate corners of the realms and eke out a meager existence, traveling routes between campsites and caves as the seasons change. Although gray orcs are comfortable with the savage life of the barbarian, they tend to be calmer and collected than northern orcs, focusing their rage and hatred inward. This allows them to excel as clerics of the warlike orc deities. Gray Orcs are zealots, and the word of their tribal clerics is law. Clerics from other tribes are usually viewed as heretics, despite the fact that both tribes likely worship the same deity.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom Score increases by 1. Alternatively, you may choose to have altered base statistics; if you do so, your Intelligence score does not decrease by 2.

- **Pious.** You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.

- **Bloodfury.** The scent of your blood in the heat of a battle enrages you. While you are below half your maximum hit points you may use your action make a special melee attack against one creature within your reach, striking with vicious ferocity. If your attack hits, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Horde Vengeance.** You can use your action to make a special melee attack against a creature who reduced an allied humanoid to 0 hit points during their last turn, using your **Bloodfury** trait regardless of your hitpoint total and without expending your single use of **Bloodfury**.

#### Mountain Orc
A Mountain Orc is quite obviously a monstrous creature to most of the civilized folk of the realms. Standing at seven or more feet in height, they have stocky, powerful necks, and their bestial heads seem to sit directly on their massive shoulders. Their eyes are always a deep shade of red or green, and their faces are dominated by porcine snouts and large tusks. Mountain orcs often weave braids and tiny bones into their thick matted hair, which is usually black. They are far from the cleanest race on Faerûn and delight in decorating their bodies with scars and warpaint.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score or your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Musclebound.** You gain proficiency in the Athletics Skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Strength (Athletics) ability check you make to initiate, maintain, or break free of a grapple.

- **Charging Pin.** When you use your bonus action to move as a part of the Agressive trait, as a part of that bonus action you may try to grapple a creature that is large or smaller in your path. Make an Athletics contest with the creature. If you succeed, you crash into the creature. Both you and the creature are knocked prone. The creature is also grappled and takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level + your Strength modifier. On a failed contest you miss and land prone 10 feet past the creature

#### Orog (Underdark Orc)
Having emerged from the depths of the underdark, Orogs are disciplined, straightforward, and almost entirely unafraid of danger. They are also known to be talented smiths. Over the centuries, orogs have mastered the art of forging armor and weapons from the strange ores found in the Underdark. They favor half-plate and full plate armor, which are typically adorned with armor spikes. Orog weapons are covered with a multitude of hooks, spines, and redundant cutting edges. Their armor and weapons rival the power and effectiveness, if not the grace and finesse of the great dwarf and elf smiths.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength or Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Superior Darkvision.** Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.

- **Deep Denizen.** Orogs have seen true fear in the depths, and chose to charge into it, not away. You may choose to instead succeed on one failed saving throw against being frightened. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

- **Darkforged.** Orogs train from an early age at their tribal forges. You are proficient in smith's tools. In addition, when using your smith's tools to craft a weapon or piece of armor you may increase the cost of the item by 25 gp to add hooks, sharp edges and spikes to the crafted item. Creatures that are not Orogs are not proficient in using this equipment. You may craft the following equipment:

***Serrated Armor.*** While wearing serrated armor that you are proficient with, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, or when a creature attempts to escape your grapple, the creature takes piercing damage equal to half your proficiency bonus if you win the Athletics contest.

***Rending Weapon.*** If you have advantage on an attack roll with a rending weapon you are proficient with, you may choose to forgo the benefit of the advantage to attempt to rend a creature with the jagged edges of your weapon. If you hit, the target’s walking speed is reduced by half.
In addition, when a rended creature walks, they take 1 piercing damage for every 5 feet they move. Other forms of movement (fly, burrow, swim, etc.) aren’t affected. The speed reduction ends when the target receives a DC 12 Medicine check, recieves healing, or after 24 hours, whatever comes first. A rending attack does not slow creatures that are immune to piercing or slashing damage.

#### Neo-Orog (Thayan Red Orc)
A few demented wizards tried to create their own race of orcs, as violent but loyal slaves. Unnaturally splicing Orogs, Orcs, and Ogres, they created a creature unlike any natural born orc. They emerge from a sac fully grown and are always sterile. Neo-Orogs are living weapons bred as elite shock troops. They are stronger than almost any other orc, and their skin is dark, mottled red, and eyes a deep yellow. Very few independent groups of them exist, and most who do escape their masters become chaotic mercenaries, or hired muscle.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity or Strength score increases by 1.

- **War Caller.** If an ally within 30 feet of you reduces an enemy creature's hit points to 0, you may use your reaction to shout, invigorating your nearby allies. Up to six allies you choose within 30 feet of you have advantage on all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, as well as saving throws against Death until the end of your next turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Crush the Weak.** You are a weapon of war, knocking back lesser foes with incredible power. Whenever you make a melee attack against a medium or smaller creature while wielding a heavy weapon, you can choose to take disadvantage on the attack roll to gain an additional 1d6 weapon damage on hit and you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you. If you already have disadvantage on an attack, you may not use this trait.

- **Topple the Mighty.** When you score a critical hit with a heavy melee weapon against a huge or smaller creature, you may choose to strike the creature to the ground. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus or be knocked prone.
