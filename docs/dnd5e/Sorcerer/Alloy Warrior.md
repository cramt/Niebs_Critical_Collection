#Sorcerer
***Progressively, more and more of the world is made from metal. While some see this as unnatural and a perversion of nature, other's have embraced this reality. They choose to adapt and bend the world of metal to their wills.***

*As a Metal sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you brimming with power? Consult the Metal Origins table for a possible origin of your powers.*

||~ Metal Origins |
|d6 |Origin |

| 5 | You were an experiment gone wrong. Or perhaps gone right? |

### Alloy Spells
Starting from 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Alloy Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

### Metal Connection
Starting from 1st level, your connection to creations of metal allows you to be more effective on the battlefield. You gain proficiency in medium armour as well as simple- and martial weapons made of metal.

### Orbital Offense
At 1st level, you can manipulate small metal objects. As a bonus action, you can touch a number of tiny metal objects, each weighing no more than 5 lbs, up to your Charisma modifier and make them float for 1 minute. The objects occupy the same space as you and follow you when you move.

Additionally, if you affect a melee weapon you are proficient with using this feature, you can attack with it utilizing your Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls, as the weapon flies through the air to strike at your foes. When you attack with a weapon in this manner, its reach is increased by 5 feet.

The weight limit for objects you can affect with this feature increases by 5 lbs when you reach 5th level (10 lbs), 11th level (15 lbs), and 17th level (20 lbs).

### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Metal Sense
Starting from 14th level, while conscious, you can sense any piece of metal larger than a coin within 60 feet of you.

### Metal Bulwark
At 14th level, you can use your connection to metal to lift yourself up. While wearing armour made of metal, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and you can use your movement to float.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in heavy armour and ignore the Strength requirement for all amours.

### Metal Mincer
At 18th level, wearing metal armour is ill-advised when going against you. As an action, you can target a number of creatures up to your Charisma Modifier that are made of metal or wearing metal armour and force them to succeed on a Consitution saving throw against your spell DC.
On a failed save, a creature takes 6d12 magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and is restrained for 1 minute. A creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success.
On a successful save, the damage is halved, and the creature's speed is halved until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.
