#Sorcerer
***An event in your familyâ€™s distant past permanently tainted your blood with necrotic energies. It might have been dabbling with necromancy, attempting lichdom, or an ancient curse. Whatever it was, it now gives certain members of your family strange forbidden powers.***

### Necrotic Sorcerer Quirks
At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Necrotic Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

|d6 |Quirk |
|---|---|
| 1 | Your skin is extremely pale. |
| 2 | Your breath always smells rotten. |
| 3 | Your eyes glow faintly with cursed light. |
| 4 | Others feel a strange feeling of unease around you. |
| 5 | You feel strangely attracted to grave-sites. |
| 6 | When you smile, it always seems forced. |

### Necrotic Spells
Starting from 1st level, you learn to utilize the necrotic energies found within you to cast certain spells.

You gain the [[dnd5e/Spell/Spare The Dying\|Spare the Dying]] cantrip, which counts as a sorcerer cantrip for you, but not against your number of cantrips.

Additionally, you gain the following spells at the listed sorcerer level. These spells do not count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. If you gain a spell that does not appear on the sorcerer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a sorcerer spell for you.

### Grave Walker
Starting at 1st level, you have an uncanny ability to hide amongst undead creatures. At the end of a short or long rest, an invisible magical aura emanates from you. The aura disappears if you cast a spell that deals damage or attack with a weapon.

Hostile undead creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed on a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC at the start of their turns. On a successful save, the creature acts as normal and is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature ignores you until the aura ends.

Creatures that are immune to Charm effects are not affected by this feature.

### Drag Into the Beyond
Starting at 6th level, spells you cast ignore resistance to necrotic damage, and you can add your Charisma modifier to spells that deal necrotic damage. Additionally, you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

### Drag From the Beyond
Starting at 6th level, undead created by you are strengthened by the negative energies that flow through you. When you cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Animate Dead\|Animate Dead]], you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:

- The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your sorcerer level.

- The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

### Grave Control
At 14th level, your affinity with undead greatly increases. The radius of your Grave Walker feature increases to 60 feet. Any undead creature with a challenge rating equal to or below your proficiency bonus automatically fails its saving throw against your Grave Walker feature.

Additionally, when you create an undead using spells, the duration they remain under your control is doubled.

### Master of Undeath
Starting at 18th level, you become a master of controlling undead. You gain immunity to necrotic damage and your hit point maximum cannot be reduced. Any undead creature you create using spells remain under your control permanently.

Additionally, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Animate Dead\|Animate Dead]] spell to gain control over zombies and skeletons that you have not created yourself.
