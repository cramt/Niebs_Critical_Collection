#Dwarf
***Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs – these common threads unite all dwarves.***

### Dwarf Features

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

- **Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Invisibility\|Invisibility]] spell on yourself once with this trait. You don't need material components for either spell, and you can't cast them while you're in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

- **Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on Attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

#### Azerblood
Azerblood dwarves are a rare sight, having been born from an azer, slaves of the efreet and natives of the Elemental Plane of fire. Legends say that long ago dwarves and azer were once the same race, but today's dwarves escaped their giant masters, while the azer were corrupted into beings of fire. Because the azer and dwarves share this ancient ancestry, there have been groups of escaped azer who found dwarven mates on the material plane, and these gave rise to the first Azerblood dwarves. These dwarves have deep red hair, eyes that burn like a yellow or orange flame, and an innate magic that allows them to channel heat into material around them.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

- **Fire Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.

- **Inner Fire.** Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Heat Metal\|heat metal]] spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell

#### Dream Dwarf
Dream dwarves are an ordinary-looking, but mystically gifted subset of the stout-folk who possess ethereal sight. They share a profound connection with the earth around them, and are able to enter a trance they call the earth dream, which allows them to learn through the earth by accessing a sort of collective consciousness. Dream dwarves are a rare sight, and most can’t tell them apart from a hill dwarf.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom or Intelligence score increases by 1.

- **Earth Dream.** Once per day, when you take a long rest in a natural environment, you can enter a trance-like state where the earth speaks to you through your dreams. This feature doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns. At the end of your rest, you instantly gain knowledge of one fact of your choice about one of the following subjects as it relates to the area within 500 feet of you:

- Terrain and bodies of water
- Prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
- Buildings

#### Wild Dwarf
Wild dwarves, who call themselves “dur Authalar” (the People), are primitive inhabitants of Chult and the deep jungles of the realms.

They have largely rejected the culture of their cousins, choosing instead to live in hunting bands with ever-shifting memberships. Dur Authalar have more in common with the beasts of the jungle than they do with their dwarven kin, viewing life as an endless hunt and each day a struggle to kill or be killed. Wild dwarves are dark-skinned, short, and stout, with dark brown eyes. Their heavily tattooed bodies are covered with grease to ward off insects and make them hard to hold. Wild dwarves wear little except their long, woven hair, which serves as adequate clothing.

**Altered Base Statistics.** Wild Dwarves do not gain the **Stonecunning** or **Tool Proficiency** traits. They have left the crafting and smithing aspects of dwarven life behind.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.

- **Wild Training.** You are proficient with the poison kit, nature skill, and blowgun.

- **Slick Skin.** If you are wearing a salve for insect repellent or at least 1/10 of a flask of oil, and you are not wearing armor, you have advantage on attempts to escape a grapple. In addition, you can use your action to make a DC 15 sleight of hand check to escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a rope bound around your limbs.

- **Toughened Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against disease.
