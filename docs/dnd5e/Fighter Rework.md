If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### • Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### • Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

##### • Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

##### • Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### • Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

##### • Superior Technique
You learn one maneuver of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Fighter Rework/Maneuvers\|list of Maneuvers]]. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it.
You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

##### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

##### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### • Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you. 

### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Combat Superiority
Beginning at 3rd level, you learn [[dnd5e/Fighter Rework/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

***Maneuvers.*** You learn three [[dnd5e/Fighter Rework/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

***Superiority Dice.*** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)


### Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques:
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Arcane Archer\|Arcane Archer]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Banneret\|Banneret]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Battle Master\|Battle Master]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Bulwark\|Bulwark (GH)]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Cavalier\|Cavalier]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Champion\|Champion]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Echo Knight\|Echo Knight]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Eldritch Knight\|Eldritch Knight]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Gunslinger\|Gunslinger (MM)]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Living Crucible\|Living Crucible (GH)]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Psi Warrior\|Psi Warrior]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Rune Knight\|Rune Knight]]
- [[dnd5e/Fighter/Samurai\|Samurai]]
The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Martial Versatility
Starting at 4th level, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial practice:
* Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
* If you know any maneuvers, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
