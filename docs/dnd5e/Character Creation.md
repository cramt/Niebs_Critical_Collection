#CharacterCreation
**When creating your character, you can either choose to use the standard array, use the point-buy system or roll your stats. I would recommend simply using the standard array, to ensure a balanced and fun experience**

* The standard array is as follows: [[dnd5e/15,\|14, 13, 12, 10, 8]]

* Point buy can be found here (use standard settings): http:*chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html

* When rolling your own stats, you roll 4d6 and remove the lowest number. You do this **six** times and choose which stats you want where from your 6 rolls. For example, you roll 4d6 and roll the following: [[dnd5e/5,\|4, 3, 3]]. You would then remove the lowest number, in this case [[dnd5e/5,\|4, 3, --3--]] and your total would end up being **12** (5 + 4 + 3).

* You can choose to forgo the ability score increase from your chosen race and subrace and instead increase an ability score of your choice by 2, and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

* Every character can choose a feat at 1st level. You cannot choose any of the feats where you get a penalty to hit, and then add damage. Always remember to ask the dm when choosing a feat. You do not gain an additional feat when multiclassing into a new class.

* Certain classes get access to additional feats at level 1, in addition to your chosen 1st-level feat. See the [[dnd5e/Starter Feats\|Starter Feats]] page for more information.
