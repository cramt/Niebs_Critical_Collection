#Reborn
***Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal fates, their ashen flesh, missing limbs, or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.***

#### Faded Memories
Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent.
Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.

Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.

||~ Lost Memories |
|d6 |Memory |
|---|---|
| 1 | You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to? |
| 2 | A memory causes you to shed a tear. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way? |
| 3 | You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you? |
| 4 | A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you? |
| 5 | You recall enjoying something that you can’t stand doing now. What is it? Why don’t you like it now? |
| 6 | A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience? |

#### Reborn Origins
Reborn might originate from circumstances similar to those of various undead or constructs. Roll on or choose an option from the Reborn Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.

|d8 |Origin |
|---|---|
| 1 | You were magically resurrected but something went wrong. |
| 2 | Stitches bind your body’s mismatched pieces, and your memories come from multiple different lives. |
| 3 | After clawing free from your grave, you realized you have no memories except for a single name. |
| 4 | You were a necromancer’s undead servant for years. One day, your consciousness returned. |
| 5 | You awoke in an abandoned laboratory alongside complex designs for clockwork organs. |
| 6 | You were released after being petrified for generations. Your memories have faded, though, and your body is not what it once was. |
| 7 | Your body hosts a possessing spirit that shares its memories and replaces your missing appendages with phantasmal limbs. |
| 8 | In public, you pass as an unremarkable individual, but you can feel the itchy straw stuffing inside you. |
