#Goblin
***Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, and they react by lashing out at any creatures they believe they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat.***

- **Age.** Goblins reach adulthood at age 8 and live up to 60 years.

- **Alignment.** Goblins are typically neutral evil, as they care only for their own needs. A few goblins might tend toward good or neutrality, but only rarely.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

#### Hoardshine Goblin
Having emerged less than two centuries from a portal to the Feywild, Hoardshine Goblins greatly resemble other goblins, with yellow, red-brown or green skin and similarly colored eyes. Their behaviour is their greatest difference, as they are more talkative, inventive, and more interested in barter than conquest. A proper market of the Hordeshine Goblin is a sight to behold, rivaling the greatest bazaars of mortal cities for the variety of exotic goods available.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Golden Bribe.** When you are bartering, bargaining, or dealing with currency and you fail a persuasion roll you may spend a number of gold coins equal to two times the number you failed by to instead succeed on the persuasion roll. If the failed roll had disadvantage, you must spend a number of gold coins equal to five times the number you failed by.

- **Feywild Token.** Hoardshine goblins are capable of enchanting currency with fey charms. Once per day, you may take one coin and rub it between your hands, charming the coin for 10 minutes. Whenever a creature holds the coin or has it on their person, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. (DC equals 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Proficiency bonus) On a failed save, you have advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature until the charm on the coin ends. A creature that is immune to the charmed condition automatically succeeds the saving throw.

#### Indigo Goblin
Also called “Blues”, these goblins are born different, with strange psychic abilities unlike their kin. Blues support other normal goblins in combat and often are called upon to lead a gang of goblins from the rear into battle. It is not uncommon for Blues to be killed by their own kin out of fear of their powers. As such, Blues are often extremely paranoid.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

- **Mind Shield.** Your psionic capabilities give you resistance to psychic damage.

- **Contact Telepathy.** Blues huddle with their goblin gang to coordinate attack plans. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you are touching that you share a language with. Psionic Talent. Objects around you tend to move and fly about. You know the mage hand cantrip. 

#### Monkey Goblin (Forest Kith)
Though they can stand upright, the jungle-dwelling Forest Kith tend to run and walk on all fours in a manner like primates, perhaps because their arms are longer than their legs. Unlike most goblins, Forest Kith also have an ape-like tail for climbing trees. Forest Kith hunt most creatures that travel through their forest territories. In lean times, they often plan and execute raids on humanoid frontier communities for food, preferring snatch-and-run tactics.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Perehensile Tail.** You have a tail that allows you to grab and manipulate objects, as well as assist you in climbing and swinging. You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. You can also use your tail to interact with items up to 5 lbs as though it were a third hand. You cannot attack with the tail.

- **Tree Shape.** You can use your action to change form into a small tree, or shrub with 1 HP and 14 AC. While transformed you do not need to eat, sleep or breathe, you cannot see, speak, or perform any actions, and your speed becomes 0. You can still hear while transformed. You can dismiss this effect as an action, and it ends automatically at sunset or if you take damage.

- **Brush Break.** If you use your Nimble Escape trait to use the Hide action while you are hiding in a tree or bush, you have advantage on that roll.

#### Mountain Goblin
Small, mischievous, and tinkers by nature, the goblins that live in the mountain ranges of the realms are grey or green-skinned creatures who take glee in pulling tricks on travelers. Unfortunately for the travellers, these tricks generally involve the launching of explosives, avalanches, fire traps, or other tools of mischief. They are smarter and crafter than the average goblin, but no wiser in their use and almost constantly end up within the blast radius of their own explosive devices.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Duck!** You have resistance to all damage that originates from Tiny devices you have constructed.

- **Firestick.** You may use torches as clubs that deal an additional 1 fire damage on hit while they are lit. Torches you wield gain the *light*, *finesse*, and *thrown (15/25)* properties. You can add your proficiency bonus to your attack and damage rolls when wielding torches in this way.

- **Tick, Tick, Boom!** You have proficiency with tinker's tools. Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of scrap metal to construct a *Tiny device (AC 5, 1 hp)*.

The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it.), when it explodes, or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim 1d10 gold worth of scrap.

You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options: 

***Clockwork Goblin.*** This device is a clockwork goblin soldier with an explosive attached. You may use an action to wind it up and place it on the ground. When placed, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in the direction it is facing. It makes a shrill laughing noise as it moves. If the toy goblin impacts a creature or object, is destroyed, or walks for 5 turns, it stops, clicks, and explodes in a 5 foot sphere dealing 1d6 fire damage to creatures and objects within the sphere.

***Inferno Kindler.*** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. You may also overload the device, causing the fire to grow in intensity for one minute. The device can be used as a torch while overloaded, after which it is burnt out and unusable. If you roll a 1 on an attack while wielding the device as a torch, it explodes, dealing 1d8 fire damage in a 10 foot sphere. Using the device requires your action.

***Scrap Grenade.*** The device is a ball of explosives and scrap metal with a wind up key. You may use an action to wind it up and throw it into an open space up to 30 feet away. Once wound, the ball begins ticking. At the end of your next turn, the device explodes in a 10 foot sphere dealing 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 piercing damage to anything within the sphere. If the device is destroyed, the ticking stops and the ball does not explode.

#### Wolfraid Goblin
How such a pathetic race such as the goblins were able to tame the wild and ferocious nature of the worg is beyond any scholars guess, but the goblins who have achieved this feat are known as wolfraid goblins. They are amongst the most feared goblin warriors to ever plague the open plains of the realms. Their marauding nature is the bane of civilised humanoid towns. They have green skin and often wear trophies or headdresses to represent their affinity with the wolf.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Wolf Raider.** These marauding goblins are known for riding their wolves and worgs into battle. You gain proficiency in the animal handling skill.

- **Wolf Tamer.** If you are within 1 mile of an arctic, forest, grassland, hill, or mountain environment, you can spend 8 hours to cast find steed using this trait with 1 lb of fresh meat as a material component. Your steed can take no other form than a wolf (MM), and it remains a beast instead of a celestial, fey or fiend. Only you can ride the wolf steed. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

- **Wild Command.** You can use your action to command your wolf steed to take the Attack action. Your wolf steed will not attack otherwise. 

- **Fury of the Small.** When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
