#Mutant
***Whether your transformation began from the raw chaos of the far realms, the constant change of the Feywild, or at the whim of some capricious spirit or deity, you are now a mutant; an agent of chaos. Your body is in constant flux, evolving and mutating, growing less and less for each day that passes, but you are instead becoming something else.***

***The mutant will often be seen by others as a monster, with clawed hands and glowing eyes, that prowl the dark of night. While this can be true, no two mutants are ever necessarily the same. The physical changes a mutant goes through does make life in regular society difficult though, and many do live alone, whether this means in the sewers of a large city or far out in the forests or mountains of the wild. Some do try to blend in, and often become very adept at disguises instead.***

*You must have a Constitution score of 13 or higher and Strength or Dexterity score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

- Leather Armor, a Component pouch, and a dagger

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 2d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Catalyst
At 1st level, you have been changed somehow, and continue to shift and change as you level up. The source of this change, its Catalyst, helps define the flavour of your abilities.
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Alchemy\|Alchemy]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Machine\|Machine]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Nature\|Nature]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Ooze\|Ooze]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Otherworldly\|Otherworldly]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Undead\|Undead]]
- [[dnd5e/Mutant/Unstable Magic\|Unstable Magic]]
Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Natural Weapon
When first manifesting the powers granted by this class at 1st level, a mutant’s hands mutate to manifest a set of natural weapons of some kind. The weapon's appearance varies greatly from user to user and based on the chosen Catalyst. Whether they are a set of razor-sharp claws instead of nails, a pair of long and sharp wrist-blades, or just hardened bone and skin to allow for a powerful slam attack, they deal 1d6 physical damage of an appropriate type (piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning). You can use either Dexterity or Strength for the Attack and Damage Rolls of your unarmed strikes with these natural weapons.

At later levels, you gain additional natural weapons from other features. Whenever a class feature or subclass feature refers to natural weapons, these later natural weapons are also counted.

### Unarmored Defense
Starting from 1st level, one of your first changes when you become a Mutant you manifest a form of natural defence. You gain one of the following features of your choice:

**Unnatural Toughness.** Your bones harden, and muscles grow thick and wiry, making you harder to harm. While you are wearing no armour and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

**Thick Hide.** Your skin thickens, grows fur, or shifts into a scaly hide. While you are wearing no armour and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 13 + your Constitution modifier.

### Mutations
The evolution of your form causes it to alter in various natural or unnatural ways, allowing you to perform feats which would be impossible for normal individuals.

At 2nd level, you gain two Mutations of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Mutant/Mutations\|list of mutations]]. When you gain certain Mutant levels, you gain additional mutations of your choice.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mutations you know and replace it with another mutation that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in a mutation refers to Mutant level, not character level.

### A Sight to Behold
At 2nd level, your appearance has grotesquely transformed.
Your body has twisted into one of countless horrific visages. You may have bulging masses of flesh protruding from your body, be adorned with countless eyes, look something akin to a werebeast, or a bone and tusk covered natural weapon. 

Regardless of your true form, you're a horrific figure to behold. You can sustain this form or choose to manifest the appearance of the humanoid you once were, however, this is a taxing endeavour and requires concentration. This form is not permanent, and moments of stress are likely to reveal your true nature.
 
In the following situations your true form is revealed:

* Concentrating on a spell.
* Gaining the unconscious condition.
* Entering hallowed ground.
* Choosing to reveal yourself.

In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, a GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing, to see if you maintain your humanoid form.

Non-evil creatures that witness your true form may become instantly hostile to you, unless the GM decides otherwise.

While in your true form, you gain disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks. However, When your mutations and deformities are on display, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

### Catalyst Magic
At 2nd level, you also gain the ability to cast a limited number of spells. This is not spellcasting in the usual sense, but something closer to you rapidly mutating to conform to the world around you. However, the normals rules for spellcasting still apply.

#### Stamina Points
You gain a pool of 4 stamina points that you can use to cast spells. This represents a limited pool of energy that you can utilize to cast spells.

When you wish to cast a spell you expend a number of stamina points to create a spell slot of a given level as indicated on the stamina point cost table, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can’t reduce your stamina point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent stamina points when you finish a long rest.

||~ Stamina Point Cost |
|Spell Slot Level |Stamina Point Cost |
|---|---|
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Cause Fear\|Cause Fear]], you can cast the spell by expending 2 stamina points.

The number of stamina points you have to spend increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the stamina points column on the mutant class table.

#### Maximum Spell level
As your level increases, so does your power. Your mutant level also determines the maximum level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can’t do so.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Mutant\|mutant spell list]].

The Spells Known column of the mutant table shows when you learn more mutant spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can create spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Mutant\|mutant spell list]]. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mutant spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Mutant\|mutant spell list]], which also must be of a level for which you can create spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your mutant spells since the power of your magic relies on your ability to control your own body. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mutant spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
As your catalyst changes your body, and is the source of your magic, all of your mutations and evolved features act as a Spellcasting Focus for your Shifter spells.

### Evolved Offense
Upon reaching 3rd level, the Mutant manifests a secondary natural weapon, which it can use on each of its turns as a Bonus Action, as long as the Attack action is not being performed to attack with any regular weapons. These natural weapons also all count as unarmed attacks, and have the *Finesse* and *Light* properties (unless explicitly saying otherwise). Exactly how, or where on your body, these things manifest is up to you. Functionally though, you gain one of the following features of your choice:

**Tentacle.** One or several long tentacles protrude from your body. You can make a melee attack against a creature within 15 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**Tail Swipe.** You have grown a tail, which you can use to perform a melee attack against a creature within 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Pincer.** One of your hands (or tail, if you have one) grow into a large crab-like pincer. Make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. This secondary attack lacks the *Finesse* property.

Alternatively, you can use your Bonus Action to attempt to grapple an opponent within reach.

**Poisoned Spike.** Make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet, dealing 1d4 piercing damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your Spell save DC, taking 1d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Bite.** You have grown sharp fangs, large tusks, strong mandibles, or other large teeth that allows for dangerous bites. Make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a hit.

At 11th level you manifest a second natural weapon from the list above. You cannot pick the same one a second time. Whenever you qualify to attack with these natural weapons as a Bonus Action, you can attack with both of them.

### Ranged Weaponry
At 3rd level you manifest an additional natural weapon for attacking your prey at range. These natural weapons all require an Action to use, but they also leave you eligible to use the weaponry from Evolved Offense as a bonus action, if you have a target within range.

**Poisoned Quills.** You grow poisonous quills somewhere on your body, which can easily detach when you so wish them to. As an action, you can make a ranged weapon attack to launch the quills against a creature within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 poison damage, plus your Constitution modifier and it can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
The damage of these quills increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Acid Spit.** Your stomach produces an unusually strong acid, allowing you to digest many things which would be inedible to others. You can also spit large globs of this acid a creature within 30 feet. Make a ranged weapon attack, and on a hit the target takes 1d10 acid damage, plus your Constitution modifier.
The damage of this acid increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

**Eyebeam.** One of your eyes is abnormally large and bulbous, and have a faint glow to it. As an action, you can focus your gaze on a creature within 60 feet, and make a ranged weapon attack, as you create a bright beam from this eye. On a hit, it takes 1d8 necrotic damage, plus your Constitution modifier, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
The damage of this beam increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Just as with all of your other natural weapons, the exact form these manifest into will vary from Mutant to Mutant, and often depend on the catalyst of that Mutant.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Rapid Attacks
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice with your natural melee weapon, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on Your Turn.

### Primal Strikes
At 6th level, your attacks with all of your natural weapons manifested from this class count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Always In Motion
At 7th level, you start to grow a greater degree of control of the chaotic forces at work within yourself. At the end of each Long Rest, you can choose one of your Mutations to replace with another one. You must meet all prerequisites for the newly selected Mutation as well.

### Evasion
At 13th level, your instincts and natural reactions continue to evolve and improve, letting you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Endless Evolution
At 20th level, you truly become a creature of endlessly shifting chaos. Your form changes day by day, so much so that you sometimes don’t even recognize yourself anymore. Whenever you finish a short or long rest you can replace one of your Mutations, or a natural weapon gained from this class with a different one of your choice.
