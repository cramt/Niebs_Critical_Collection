#Tabaxi
***Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.***

### Tabaxi Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Age.** Tabaxi have lifespans equivalent to humans.

- **Alignment.** Tabaxi tend toward chaotic alignments, as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They are rarely evil, with most of them driven by curiosity rather than greed or other dark impulses.

- **Size.** Tabaxi are taller on average than humans and relatively slender. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Feline Agility.** Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your tum in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the tum. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

- **Cat's Claws.** Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Cat's Talent.** You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.

You can replace your **Ability Score Increase**, **Feline Agility**, and **Cat’s Talent** traits with any of the following:

#### Tabaxi Pridehead
With a flowing mane, strong face, and a powerful roar, pridehead tabaxi are similar to lions both in appearance and temperment. These fearsome tabaxi are rumored to be descended from tabaxi lords, tabaxi who were given power by demonic magic. None of the demons evil magic remains in their descendents, but the signs of their heritage remain. Prideheads are often the leaders of tabaxi clans, as growing a large mane is often seen as a sign of great potential.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution, Charisma, and Strength scores each increase by 1.

- **Lion’s Roar.** As an action you can unleash a terrifying roar that can shake the confidence of your foes. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC for the save equals 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

Once you use this trait you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Pride's Talent.** You have proficiency in the Athletics and Intimidation skills.

#### Tabaxi Stripeback
With stripes and coloration like a tiger, these tabaxi are natural hunters who use their muscular legs and sharp claws to pounce on foes. Orange stripebacks are most commonly seen slinking through the shadows of the jungle, while white stripebacks reside in arctic environments at high elevations.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. 

- **Tiger’s Claws.** Your claws are longer and sharper than other tabaxi. Your natural weapons deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 

- **Hunter’s Grace.** You can use your hind legs to make incredible leaps, and unerringly land on your feet. Your jump distance is doubled unless it was already increased by a magical effect.

- **Pouncing Strike.** If you have at least one hand free, as an action you can use your movement to make a ferocious leap towards a creature you can see, making a single unarmed strike against that creature. If the attack hits and the creature is large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
The DC for the save equals 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

You can use this feature twice and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
