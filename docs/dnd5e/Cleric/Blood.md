#Cleric
***The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within one’s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell. Clerics of blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson.***

### Bonus Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

### Bloodletting Focus
From 1st level, your divine magics draw the blood from inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your nearby foes. When you use a spell of 1st level or higher to inflict damage to any creatures that have blood, those creatures suffer additional necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature’s actions against their will.

As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature that has blood within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately move up to half of their movement in any direction of your choice and make a single weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range. Dead or unconscious creatures automatically fail their saving throw. At 8th level, you can target a Huge or smaller creature.

### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to focus on a sample of blood from a creature that is at least 2 ounces, and that has been spilt no longer than a week ago.

As an action, you can focus on the blood of the creature to form a bond and gain information about their current circumstances. You know their approximate distance and direction from you, as well as their general state of health, as long as they are within 10 miles of you. You can maintain this effect as though you were concentrating on a spell for up to 1 hour.

During your bond, you can spend an action to attempt to connect with the bonded creature’s senses. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, the connection is resisted, ending the bond. You suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Upon a failed saving throw, you can choose to either see through the eyes of or hear through their ears of the target for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). During this time, you are blind or deaf (respectively) with regard to your own senses.

Once this connection ends, the Crimson Bond is lost.

### Sanguine Recall
At 8th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots. As an action, you recover spell slots that have a combined level equal to or less than half of your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You immediately suffer 1d6 necrotic damage per spell slot level recovered. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, if you are an 8th-level cleric, you can recover up to four levels of spell slots. You can recover a single 4th-level spell slot, two 2nd-level spell slots, a 3rd-level spell slot and a 1st level spell slot, or four 1st-level spell slots. You then suffer 4d6 damage.

### Vascular Corruption Aura
At 17th level, as an action, you can emit a powerful aura that extends 30 feet out from you. This aura pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes, causing them to burst and bleed.

For 1 minute, any enemy creatures with blood that begin their turn within the aura or enter it for the first time on their turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any enemy creature with blood that would regain hit points while within the aura only regains half of the intended number of hit points (rounded up).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
