***A deity involved in the Black Powder Domain is generally less focused on how a problem gets solved, and more that it does. This is not to say that they are all lawless - some being the exact opposite - instead of choosing to utilize the innovations of firearms as a way to get a job done quickly and dirtily. Gods of this domain may revel in death or ingenuity and tend to be any alignment, just a little less nice than normal. They might send their clerics to tie up loose ends or keep people in line with their personal morals.***

### Firearm Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with firearms and Tinker's Tools.

### Guided Repairs
From 1st level, you can call upon your god to quickly do maintenance. As a bonus action, you can reload a firearm or attempt to fix a broken (but not misfired) firearm. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Early Warning
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to ensure one creature is ready when things go south. As a reaction when you or a willing creature within 30 feet of you rolls initiative, you may use your Channel Divinity to set their initiative score to 20. You must do this before they roll and before you know the rest of the initiative order.

### Channel Divinity: Faceoff
By 6th level, you can also use your Channel Divinity to dish out punishment to multiple enemies at once.
 
As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and choose a number of enemies that you can see within your firearm's first range incriment, up to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of one). You make firearm attack against each of those creatures, in an order of your choosing.

You may substitute any of these attacks for a reload, or reload via another method between attacks.

### Divine Strike
Starting at 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Combat Magic
At 17th level, when you use your action to cast a cleric spell, you can make one firearm attack as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use your Channel Divinity: Faceoff feature, you can apply your Divine Strike to every hit, instead of just one, provided you have not already done so this turn.
