#Cleric
***Even the most benevolent divine beings operate outside the bounds of mortal comprehension. These eldritch forces sing a siren song that calls out for mortal worshippers through lucid dreams and the whispers of dead gods. The Eldritch domain empowers the devoted followers of unknown and distant forces of chaos, divine entities of eldritch oblivion, and dead gods.***

### Unpredictable Inspiration
At 1st level, choose a cantrip from [[dnd5e/Spells\|any spell list]]. The chosen cantrip counts as a cleric spell for you but does not count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. Each time you finish a long rest you can replace the chosen cantrip with any other cantrip of your choice.

In addition, you gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Each time you finish a long rest you can replace the chosen skill with another skill of your choice.

### Eldritch Contagion
Starting at 1st level, you’ve been gifted with the ability to impart a fleeting taste of the unknowable on others. When you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher that targets one or more creatures, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to force one of the spell’s targets to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, roll on the Eldritch Effects table and the creature suffers that effect for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This effect ends early if you use this feature again.

### Channel Divinity: Prophecy of Doom
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to speak a prophecy, inducing visions and hallucinations in nearby creatures.

As an action, choose a point within 120 feet of you that you can see and roll on the Eldritch Effects table. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the chosen point must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the temporary effect for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the temporary effect on a success.

### Otherworldly Calm
