***You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body.***

***Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.***

### Elemental Control
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn ways of turning your Ki into bursts of elemental energy. When you gain this feature, choose cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

On your turn, you can choose to have the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows deal an elemental damage type that you're trained in, instead of its normal damage type.

You gain training in another element of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

### Elemental Fists
Starting at 6th level, you can replace the damage type of your unarmed strike with an elemental damage type you're trained in.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to increase the reach of your unarmed strikes by 30 feet until the end of your turn.

### Elemental Strikes
At 6th level, you gain the ability to hurl elemental attacks at your foes from a distance.

When you gain this feature, choose one of the following elemental attacks:

**Elemental Wave.** As an action and by spending 2 Ki points, you release a wave of elemental energy in front of you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC. A creature takes 3d6 damage of an elemental type that you're trained in on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can increase the attack's damage by spending Ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3 points, increases the damage by 1d6.

**Elemental Burst.** As an action and by spending 2 Ki points, a burst of elemental energy emanates from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC. A creature takes 2d8 damage of an elemental type that you're trained in on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can increase the attack's damage by spending Ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3 points, increases the damage by 1d8.

**Elemental Line.** As an action and by spending 2 Ki points, a line of elemental energy emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC. A creature takes 3d4 damage of an elemental type that you're trained in on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can increase the attack's damage by spending Ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3 points, increases the damage by 1d4.

**Elemental Bolt.** As an action and by spending 2 Ki points, you hurl a mote of elemental energy at a creature within 120 feet. Make a ranged attack against the target, adding your Dexterity modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 damage of an elemental type that you're trained in.

You can increase the attack's damage by spending Ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3 points, increases the damage by 1d10.

You gain another elemental attack of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Elemental Protection
At 11th level, your body becomes infused with elemental energies. You gain resistance to any element that you're trained in.

In addition, you learn ways of utilizing the elemental energies in the world around you.

By spending 5 Ki points, you can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Wall Of Fire\|Wall of Fire]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Wall Of Sand\|Wall of Sand]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Wall Of Stone\|Wall of Stone]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Wall Of Water\|Wall of Water]] as an action.

The spells utilize your Ki save DC to determine saving throws.

### Elemental Being
At 17th level, you've become one with the elemental forces. You gain immunity to any element you're trained in.

Additionally, whenever you would normally take damage from an attack or spell of a type that you're trained in, you can spend a reaction to immedialty regain 2 Ki points.
