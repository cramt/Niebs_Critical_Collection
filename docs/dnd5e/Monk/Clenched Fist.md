#Monk
***Monks of the Way of the Clenched Fist differ much from other monasteries. Like most other monastic traditions, monks following the Way of the Clenched Fist spend countless years in meditation, in pursuit of harnessing their inner Ki. However, the way they choose to utilize their Ki differs from most other traditions. Unlike other monastic traditions that usually focus on deflecting outside forces and slipping between the cracks in the defenses of their opponents, followers of the Way of the Clenched Fist enjoy a more direct approach. With sudden outbursts of force, they seek to quickly, and forcefully, end conflict - so that they may return to their usual activities.***

### Forceful Fighting
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn the ways of harnessing Ki to bolster yourself in combat.

You can now calculate your Unarmored Defense as 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your Wisdom modifier.

Additionally, whenever you attack a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows using Strength, you can impose one of the following effects on the attack:

- The strikeâ€™s range is increased by 5 feet.

- If the attack hits, your opponent takes the normal damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.

- If the attack hits, the attack deals normal damage and you can attempt to grapple the enemy as a part of the attack.

### Body of Steel
Starting at 6th level, you learn to utilize your Ki to toughen your body beyond its limits. You gain the following passive benefits:

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
***Siege.*** All melee attacks using utilizing your Martial Arts deal double damage against objects and structures.

Additionally, you can spend 1 Ki point as a reaction to deflect or stop blows when you are hit by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your Monk level.

### Immovable Object
At 11th level, you have perfected your body and hardened it to its peak. You are immune to effects that would move you against your will, or knock you prone, and you are immune to being grappled by any creature that is Huge or smaller in size.

Additionally, your body is the perfect shield for your allies to take cover behind. Your body acts as full cover for any friendly medium or smaller creature that would use it as such. Be wary though, the attack might just hit you instead.

Finally, when an ally within 5 feet would be hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to move between the ally and the attack, and take the damage yourself. When you do this, you halve the attack's damage against you.

### Might of Meditation
At 17th level, your learn secret techniques of utilizing ki to empower yourself temporarily.

As an action you may spend 5 Ki points and grow to twice your normal size for 1 minute. While in this state, your Martial Arts deal extra force damage equal to a roll of your martial arts die.

Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before being able to do so again.
