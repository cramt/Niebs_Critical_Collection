#Backgrounds
Explorers pursue an isolated lifestyle traversing the wilds, driven by wanderlust or the orders of a distant patron. For an Explorer, there is no greater pursuit than to discover the lost, forgotten, and unseen reaches of the world. They may travel unaccompanied or with companions, establishing large encampments in remote areas that others would deem uninhabitable. Explorers are often employed by rulers who wish to know more about the world.

#### Known Shelters
Upon spending an hour searching, and succeeding on a Wisdom (Survival) check determined by the DM, you can determine the direction and approximate location of the nearest humanoid settlement.

This includes people who might not be accommodating such as bandits, druids, and hostile cultures. The inhabitants of the location are initially friendly to you and your allies, and they will let you seek shelter and trade among them.
