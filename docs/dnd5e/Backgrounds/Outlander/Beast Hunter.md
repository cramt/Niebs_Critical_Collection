#Backgrounds
Hunters make their living by trapping, hunting, and killing vicious beasts. Some provide meat and furs for settlements, or for trade. The strongest may become a community’s best defence against wandering monsters. They are often as brutish as the creatures they hunt, heavily scarred from close encounters with their prey. They are proficient in setting many different traps, from simple snares to spring-loaded traps and cages.

The beast hunter typically favours ranged weapons when taking down larger prey, avoiding close range where possible. Some favour stealth, lying patiently in ambush, while others revel in the thrill of the chase. Beast hunters have a natural aptitude for tracking all manner of beasts, quickly noticing signs that an animal has passed by, down to an exact time and direction of travel.

**Skill Proficiency:** Survival.
**Additional Equipment:** a net, a hunting trap, 30 feet of rope, one vial of pheromones or a pouch of bait.
