#Backgrounds
There is still land in Etharis where no humanoid has lived before, and Pioneers are the hardy folk who set out to tame that land for the first time.

Youâ€™ve learned to hunt the forest game, cultivate crops of wild flora and collect water from natural streams where fish swim abundantly. You have weathered punishing storms, migrations, and harsh winters. You and yours have adapted to the environment. Everything you own is built with your own two hands, and your aptitude in working with natural materials has provided you with shelter, tools, and clothing.

**Skill Proficiency:** Nature.
**Additional Equipment:** A shovel, a hammer and nails, a saw, spare leather, a needle and thread.

#### Handyman by Necessity
Upon spending an hour in the outdoors, and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check determined by the DM, find the necessary materials (provided there are any nearby) to mend any mundane item.

### Rank 1 - Hermit
You have had to rely on your aptitude for working with natural resources to fend for yourself in the wilds of Etharis. You have a crude shelter and a basic knowledge of foraging wild flora, but you have yet to truly make your way on the frontier.

#### Holdings:
Knowledge of a rare animal or plant that, if domesticated, could be farmed for great gain.

#### Progression Example:
Build a house, or similar building, and the beginnings of a farm.

### Rank 2 - Secluded Cultivator
You have constructed a sturdy dwelling and started to make the land support you. While your fences are rudimentary and your tools crude, you have begun to produce more than you need to survive. Others may follow you, seeing the opportunity this land offers.

#### Holdings:
A small herd or a field of crops.

A small family or group of farmhands who help tend your homestead.

#### Progression Example:
Gather a small community around your homestead.

### Rank 3 - Homestead Proprietor
You have established your own homestead, and maintain a year-round reserve of crops, salted meat and animal pelts to sustain you and your people through the winter months. People have gathered around you with specialized skills, such as carpenters, blacksmiths, and doctors. The beginning of a village has grown up around you.

#### Holdings:
A small self-sufficient, village-sized community that takes care of the daily requirements of your ranch or plantation.

A track/road that leads to the nearest town for travelling merchants to buy and sell wares.

A sizable plantation or ranch of your chosen commodity, bringing in a significant profit each harvest.

#### Progression Example:
Acquire a rare or magical animal or plant to be farmed.

### Rank 4 - Governor
Your steading is renowned for the production of its unique commodity. You are held in high regard in the surrounding provinces and known throughout the lands as a foremost producer of your chosen commodity. As the first and most influential settler in the area, it was natural to make your authority official. In your frontier town, you are the head of the local government, with all the powers and responsibilities that entails.

#### Holdings:
Your position as a local authority is your entry into the society of notable merchants, nobles, and royalty. Powerful people approach you to buy what you offer and deal with your town.

A caravansary that houses incoming and outgoing merchant caravans from across the land.

A large house for you and your family, suitable for receiving important visitors.

A small but disciplined militia to protect your homestead and its surroundings.

A political alliance with a neighbouring state that supports your independence.
