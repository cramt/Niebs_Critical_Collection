#Backgrounds
From notable socialites to distant noble family members and trusted servants, Courtiers represent the members of the aristocracy who are employed or invited by a ruler to make up their court. Courtiers live in close proximity to the ruling class to assist them and be part of their world. However, Courtiers are more often seen as schemers and manipulators than helpful assistants. The life of a Courtier is one of dangerous plots, uneasy political alliances, and the occasional act of betrayal – when it benefits them.

**Skill Proficiency:** Deception.
**Additional Equipment:** A medallion or pin displaying the house of your patron, court clothing.

#### Political Maneuvering
Upon spending an hour speaking to various people at court, and succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check determined by the DM, you can conjure and spread a rumour or piece of gossip within a court or political structure. A subject of your choice, whether it be true or false, becomes a topic of hot conversation within the court or political structure where you planted the rumour.

### Rank 1 - Chamber Keeper
You have secured a title as a minor Courtier attending to the needs of the court through menial duties such as fetching wine, or more demanding tasks such as hosting foreign visitors of lesser influence. As a Chamber Keeper, you are the unnoticed eyes of the court, making you a valuable informant for court plots.

#### Holdings:
A room or lodging provided by your patron within their estate.

A scandalous secret relating to a member of your court.

#### Progression Example:
Obtain a minor title from your patron that reflects your station.

### Rank 2 - Court Official
You have proven yourself to be a valuable asset to your patron, political allies, and other courtiers. You have been promoted to an official, granting you a minor title and the responsibilities that accompany it. These titles vary, including cofferer, master of the hunt, or any other title befitting your station.

#### Holdings:
The authority and resources associated with your minor title. For example, a coffered would control financial records, and perhaps even bank access.

Up to half a dozen servant hirelings to assist in your daily responsibilities.

#### Progression Example:
To be granted a greater court title by your patron that reflects your station.

With a greater court title, you have become an essential and respected member of the court. You may have been promoted to steward, cupbearer, master of ceremonies, or some other position of considerable influence in the court.

Additionally, you must attain an honourable title.

### Rank 4 - Royal Chamberlain
You have become the most influential member at court. Whether through earnest reputation or political manipulation, you have attained an honourable title of considerable power such as spymaster, regent, or majordomo.
