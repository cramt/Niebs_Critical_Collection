#Backgrounds
Envoys are the representatives of their governments or monarchs to others abroad. Often sent into faraway parts of the world, their responsibility is to forge new alliances, and maintain existing ones. However, much of an Envoy’s tasks are reactive – responding to a noble’s threats, securing defensive pacts in times of conflict, or bolstering border defences. Envoys go where there is conflict.
