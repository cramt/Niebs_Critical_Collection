#Backgrounds
Nobles are the blue-blooded rulers of any society, granted authority by birthright. Some are traditional feudal nobles, while others belong to ascendant merchant families. Regardless, nobles represent the highest level of authority within a social structure.

**Skill Proficiency:** Persuasion.
**Additional Equipment:** A signet ring engraved with your family crest, fine clothes.

#### Position of Privilege
Upon spending an hour speaking in your defence, and succeeding on a Charisma (Persuasion) check determined by the DM, you can exert your noble privilege to avoid the consequences of lawbreaking such as trespassing, theft, possession of contraband, unarmed assault, and other misdemeanours. You can also use this ability to reduce the consequences of more serious crimes that can’t be ignored entirely.

### Rank 1 - Dishevelled Noble
You're not in complete control of all of your family's estate and holdings. Perhaps the family lost everything in a war, or gambling debts claimed your once-proud noble estate. Or perhaps you're too young to inherit the estate, have been disowned, or something else is standing between you and gaining your full title. Despite your noble blood, you are a poor noble with little power or influence in the world. The only thing left is your title, which has gotten you out of trouble on more than one occasion. However, with hard work and some political dealings, you may climb into prominence.

#### Holdings:
A ruined estate or an estate controlled by other members of your family or some outside force.

A noble title that carries little influence.

#### Progression Example:
To be granted a barony, or holdings worthy of the title, by a Count or higher-ranking noble.

Additionally, you must restore your family household to a reputable state or gain control of it.

### Rank 2 - Lord Baron
