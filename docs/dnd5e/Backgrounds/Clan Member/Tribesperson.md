#Backgrounds
Life in a small tribe is, by definition, more close-knit than living within a city. Tribespeople work together daily and depend on one another to survive, treating each other as one step away from family. Making up the majority of the tribe, they work at all the necessary jobs to maintain their way of life, from gathering food, crafting weapons and tools, or governing disputes among tribe members.

**Skill Proficiency:** Survival.
**Additional Equipment:**  One tool kit of your choice and a waterskin.

#### Tribal Familiarity
By spending an hour in an area of natural wilderness and making a Wisdom (Survival) check determined by the DM, you can identify signs of other humanoid activity in the area. You can determine the direction of any nearby settlements and if you are familiar with the area, you know what tribe or group they belong to and their general disposition towards outsiders.

### Rank 1 - Tribal Member
You are a member of one of the tribes of Etharis. Given the dangers of the wilderness, your tasks keep you within the camp or village that your tribe calls home. Simple craft work and maintaining the tribal dwellings are the main tasks allotted to you, but should you prove yourself able and willing, the elders may see fit to grant you greater responsibilities.

#### Holdings:
Food and lodging within the tribe, either in a modest home or in a communal dwelling.

Tales from a traveler that outline a spot in the wilds with good hunting or other resources.

#### Progression Example:
Gain permission from an elder to venture out into the wilds on your own.

### Rank 2 - Hunter-Gatherer
The elders of your tribe have granted you permission to venture outside the boundaries of your settlement. As a hunter-gatherer, you are responsible not only for procuring food, but also dealing with minor threats to the tribe and exploring for new resources and possible locations for expansion.

#### Holdings:
The tools to perform your duties, including basic hunting and fishing gear, materials, and aid from local craftsmen.

The ability to recruit other tribe members to aid you in retrieving goods from the wild or helping to set up small camps outside your home territory.

#### Progression Example:
Display excellent leadership and aid the tribe during a crisis.

### Rank 3 -  Elder
Elders oversee many of the day-to-day issues within a tribe and advise the chieftain on matters of importance. Your actions on behalf of the tribe and your good judgement have earned you a place among them. The words of an elder carry great weight within the tribe, and an elder has the power to decide minor matters unilaterally. When issues require greater consideration, a number of elders may consult on the matter before rendering a decision.

#### Holdings:
Authority over the vast majority of tribe members.

A fine dwelling and free access to tribal goods and services.

#### Progression Example:
Serve the tribe wisely in times of trouble.

### Rank 4 - Chieftain
By election, trial, or some other method, you have been selected as the leader of your tribe. At home in your tribe, others may advise you, but your word is law. Where multiple tribes band together, you speak for your people.

#### Holdings:
Counsel from the elders, warlords, and spiritual leaders of your tribe.

Final authority on all tribe decisions and disputes, and complete authority over all tribe members.

The grandest house in the camp or village, which doubles as a meeting place for important meetings and visiting dignitaries
