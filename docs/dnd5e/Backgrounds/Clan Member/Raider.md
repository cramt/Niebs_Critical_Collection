#Backgrounds
You have been trained as a warrior with the specific aim of raiding other clans or settlements. Raiding parties must be able to move quickly, strike hard, and carry off enough goods to help support the tribe. The coordination to do all this requires intense training and forges a strong sense of comradery between raiders. Part of this comradery involves a strong sense of competition, each raider vying to perform daring acts or to carry back the best loot. The aftermath of a raid often involves raucous singing, drinking, and revelry, an adrenaline high buoyed by the plentiful food and drink obtained from the raided settlement.

**Skill Proficiency:** Intimidation
**Additional Equipment:** A tankard, a sack, a whetstone, and several torches.

#### Display of Strength
Upon spending an hour in a tavern, inn, or restaurant, and succeeding on a Charisma (Intimidation) check determined by the DM, you can win the respect and friendship of a local ally through drinking, carousing, boasting, and various contests of strength and skill. This ally begins as friendly to you and can provide you with information about military organizations, the local guard, and any recent battles or combat that has occurred in the area.

### Rank 1 - Shield Bearer
You are a junior warrior, serving as support for more senior members of the raiding party. Your tasks involve maintaining weapons and armor, tending to wounded warriors, and carrying loot from the raiding site. Should members of the raiding party be unable to fight, you may be called upon to take their place.

#### Holdings:
Lodging with other warriors.

An ailing mentor and knowledge of a particularly rich target for raiding.

#### Progression Example:
Take the place of a missing raider and prove yourself in combat.

### Rank 2 - Pillager
As a full member of the raiding party, you are trained to strike hard and fast, then escape with whatever loot you can find. Common tactics involve sowing confusion by setting fires or releasing livestock, or drawing the attention of the defenders to allow for easier plunder elsewhere. Your tribe depends on you as a main source of food and supplies, and your comrades depend on you to watch their backs in the chaos of a raid.

#### Holdings:
A younger warrior assigned to maintain your equipment and carry your loot.

Your pick of the goods seized on raids, in order of seniority.

#### Progression Example:
Perform deeds of notable bravery and be promoted by a warlord or chieftain.

### Rank 3 - Raid Leader
Through a number of raids you have proven yourself cunning, ruthless, and skilled at combat. As a raid leader you are tasked with not only gathering as much as you can from your targets, but ensuring that your warriors return alive. Your underlings look to you for the tactics to use during the raid, and you must reign in the more reckless raiders lest they go too far.

#### Holdings:
A fine dwelling within the village, showcasing trophies from prior raids.

Command over a raiding party and a voice at any war council.

First pick of any goods seized during a raid.

#### Progression Example:
Save a chieftainâ€™s life or defeat a sworn enemy of the tribe in single combat.

### Rank 4 - Warlord
Your deeds are legendary. When you speak, chieftains listen, and you direct policy as much as raiding. More to the point, you are the one who decides where and when to raid and how the military might of the clan will be brought to bear

#### Holdings:
Authority over at least three raiding parties within your tribe.

Access to war councils and peace negotiations.

The ability to requisition goods and recruit new raiders.
