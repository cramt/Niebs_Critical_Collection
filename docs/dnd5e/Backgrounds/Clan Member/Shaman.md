#Backgrounds
You are responsible for the spiritual well being of the tribe and its members. Depending on the nature of your tribe’s belief system you may serve to commune with the spirits of the wild, with departed ancestors, or merely act as a faith healer and dealer in superstition. All shamans possess certain common characteristics, including insight into something greater than themselves, knowledge of the various rituals and ceremonies of their people, and deep ties to the natural world.

**Skill Proficiency:** Religion.
**Additional Equipment:** A totem representing a spirit important to your clan, a clay jug, and a tinderbox.

#### Spiritual Guidance
Upon spending one hour petitioning the spirits and succeeding on an Intelligence (Religion) check determined by the DM, you may commune with the patron spirits of your tribe. These spirits may be departed ancestors or spirits of the wild itself. Should the spirits deign to respond, you may ask them for guidance on a single decision or course of action. The spirits do not offer any concrete information about the future, but do indicate their approval or disapproval of the relevant action.
