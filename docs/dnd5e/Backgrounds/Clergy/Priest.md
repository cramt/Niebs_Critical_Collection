#Backgrounds
Priests lead the common people in the teachings of their deities. They are the figureheads and leaders in the temples and shrines where they preach, providing guidance, atonement, and hope for the downtrodden. Priests often hold positions of considerable influence within their communities and are treated with reverence among common folk and nobility alike.

#### Religious Hierarchy
Upon spending an hour proving your knowledge of the divine, and succeeding on an Intelligence (Religion) check determined by the DM, you can find a contact within the local clergy. This contact begins as friendly to you and will answer questions you have regarding religion, the clergyâ€™s agenda, and local religious matters.

### Rank 1 - Acolyte
You were taken in by a modest parish, where you assist in religious services and ceremonial duties such as lighting altar candles and distributing prayer books to the congregation. The priest also educates you in religious scripture and doctrine.

#### Holdings:
You have knowledge of a senior clergy member whose teachings undermine the faith, preying on the wayward for personal gain.

Free lodging at your local temple of the faith.

#### Progression Example:
Be recommended for priesthood by a senior clergy member who has overseen your study of divine texts. You will be given a religious task that you must complete.

### Rank 2 - Priest
You oversee a local parish with a substantial following, where you perform rites, sermonise on the teachings of your deity, and provide spiritual guidance to followers whose faith has waned. You use your modest influence to inspire the virtuous, uplift the downtrodden, or incite fear.

#### Holdings:
You have a modest parish that you oversee, including humble lodgings, and regularly receive locals for confession.

You have knowledge of a wealthy noble who possesses a first edition book of scripture that the church greatly desires.

#### Progression Example:
You could either expose the senior clergy member exploiting the faith for personal gain or acquire the first edition book of scripture.

### Rank 3 - Bishop
In recognition of your service to the faith, you have risen to the title of Bishop, taking up residence in your own diocese in a major city. You oversee a number of senior clergies who seek your counsel and spiritual guidance in all aspects of the divine. Bishops are elected from senior priests in their Order and retain the title for as long as they remain true to the doctrine.

#### Holdings:
You are the steward of the largest temple of your faith in your region and receive well-appointed lodgings nearby.

You oversee your own diocese in a major city, speaking on behalf of the faith and supervising the clergy there.

#### Progression Example:
Become Cardinal in the event that a Cardinal passes away or retires, and the head of your faith appoints you in their stead due to your outstanding commitment to the faith.

### Rank 4 - Cardinal
As a Cardinal, you answer directly to the head of your faith. You oversee the diocese within your province, to root out corruption and heresy from on high. Cardinals are appointed by the head of their faith, and as such have their ear in all matters of spiritual and political adjudication.

#### Holdings:
A number of dioceses that you oversee within your province.

Free lodging at any parish or diocese that recognises your appointment, and any institution under the control of the faith.
