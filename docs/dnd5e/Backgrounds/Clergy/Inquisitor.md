#Backgrounds
You are a servant of an organised branch of religious enforcers who hunt down heretics and blasphemers within your own faith, and cultists of sinister powers. Divine justice does not discriminate, and you have mercilessly punished crimes both mundane and supernatural – a task that comes with little glory. You are deadly efficient in bringing the sinful to heel. However, corruption is rife within the Inquisition itself due to the Order’s power and authority, and those found guilty are likewise treated without mercy.

**Skill Proficiency:** Intimidation.
**Additional Equipment:** A set of manacles, a copy of the text Sins of the Heretic, a leather strap.

#### Eradicate Heresy
Upon spending an hour, and succeeding on a Charisma (Intimidation) check determined by the DM, you can find an informant and extract information. The informant will divulge information regarding the location of local cults, witch covens, and other enemies of the Divine.

### Rank 1 - Initiate
You were taken in by the church, and after showing attributes befitting of an Inquisitor you, were trained in their ways. Gruelling mental and physical training took up your time from dawn to dusk whenever you were not completing chores.

#### Holdings:
Free lodging at the inquisitorial chapter house, temple, or any other religious institutions that you currently serve.

You have knowledge of someone from your childhood who has since become affiliated with a witch coven, religious cult, or other enemies of the faith.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to the rank of Inquisitor by a Chapter Master.

### Rank 2 - Inquisitor
You have been appointed to the role of Inquisitor, charged with enforcing divine justice by hunting down cultists, spellcasters who have violated magical laws, and other threats. Many institutions recognise your Inquisitorial authority, and temples of the faith that you serve will grant you sanctuary, food, and useful information.

#### Holdings:
Access to information and equipment provided by the Order, in addition to information obtained by temples of the faith.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to Chapter Master by a Grand Theologist Inquisitor.

### Rank 3 - Chapter Master
You have risen through the ranks and now oversee an Inquisitorial Chapter. Initiates and Inquisitors alike answer to you and seek your advice in matters of executing divine justice, as well as rooting out corruption within the ranks of the faith you serve. You are still active in the field, often leading factions of Inquisitors in bringing cultist organisations and powerful spellcasters to heel.

#### Holdings:
Access to the restricted section of the chapter library, which contains all known weaknesses of supernatural entities.

Free lodging at any religious institution or temple of the faith that you serve.

Your religious institution invests you with the authority to declare people of high standing as enemies of the faith if you have irrefutable evidence of their crimes.

#### Progression Example:
Being appointed to Grand Theologist Inquisitor by the head of your Order and a panel of ranking clergy.

### Rank 4 - Grand Theologist Inquisitor
You have cultivated a reputation as a devout and accomplished Inquisitor, following the teachings of the divine, executing divine justice, and seeking divine enlightenment. You hold significant influence within and outside your Order, and Chapter Masters seek your counsel on matters of the faith and the Order’s mission.

#### Holdings:
Access to a council of Chapter Masters and other ranked clergy with whom you discuss matters of your Order.

You have the authority to dismiss and appoint chapter members to positions of power, both within the Inquisition and temples of the faith.

You have the ability to denounce those who you know (or suspect) to be enemies of the faith, dispatching Inquisitor factions to investigate and restore order.
