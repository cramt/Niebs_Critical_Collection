#Backgrounds
Charlatans can be seen in most markets separating fools from their hard-earned coin, and there is no shortage of fools. Some choose instead to exploit the upper class, claiming that the ignorance of spoilt children is far more lucrative, if a little riskier.

Ranging from the lowliest of hustlers selling miracle cure-alls to the most audacious con artists, all charlatans have a knack for fooling those unfortunate enough to cross their paths.

**Skill Proficiency:** Deception.
**Additional Equipment:** a lockbox with a secret compartment, a forged Merchant’s Guild membership certificate, imitation fine clothes.

#### False Identity
Upon spending an hour writing and talking to the right people, and succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check determined by the DM, you can create yourself a new identity with fake identification.

### Rank 1 - Peddler
You are used to lying through your teeth, telling people whatever they want to hear in order to separate them from their money. It keeps you fed and one step ahead of the law, but you’ll need a way to run bigger scams if you want to make real money.

#### Holdings:
A stash of counterfeit items that you sell and scam people with.

A secluded stoop that you use as a shelter against the elements near your place of “business”.

#### Progression Example:
Bw recruited by a gang of Hustlers, or create your own group, to participate in more organized and larger-scale scams.

### Rank 2 - Hustler
You have started to work in a group as a face man, expanding your “clientele” with more lucrative cons, such as passing off coloured glass as gemstones or bleeding wealthy marks dry with long cons.

#### Holdings:
A group of miscreants that assist your cons, with whom you split the spoils of your larceny.

#### Progression Example:
You could acquire or create plans for a large-scale con and procure the necessary elements.

### Rank 3 - Con Artist
You have become more daring in your approach, orchestrating swindles that require planning, resources, and teamwork in pursuit of a big payday. You may set your gang about duplicating famous paintings to be sold in foreign cities, for example or forging property title deeds in order to sell a building you do not own.

#### Holdings:
A team of charismatic swindlers and skilled forgers who can recreate items at your request with great accuracy and detail.

An unmarked warehouse in a disreputable part of town, where you can store and create forged items and oversee your operations.

#### Progression Example:
Successfully executing a grand con that draws the outrage of a great noble household, religious faction, or other powerful institution. It also makes you famous among other criminals.

### Rank 4 - Mastermind
You have become something of a legend within the underground. Up-and-coming swindlers approach you to learn at your feet. Whether you pass on your skills or fleece your new flock is up to you.

#### Holdings:
Many detailed plans of cons you have devised or procured.

A network of talented individuals who work at your behest, aiding you in orchestrating your ploys.
