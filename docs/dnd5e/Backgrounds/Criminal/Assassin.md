#Backgrounds

**Skill Proficiency:** Stealth.
**Additional Equipment:** A dagger, a poison vial, a set of binoculars, a grappling hook and rope.

#### Underground Connections
Upon spending an hour asking around, and succeeding on a Charisma (Persuasion) check determined by the DM, you can prove your credibility and find a contact in a local Thievesâ€™ Guild, or underground network. This contact begins as friendly to you and will assist you with matters related to their criminal endeavours.

You can find murder-for-hire jobs only available. These jobs typically pay more than a legal contract of their type. However, they are almost always illegal.
