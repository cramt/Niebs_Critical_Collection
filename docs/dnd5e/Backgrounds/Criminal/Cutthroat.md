#Backgrounds
Some crooks lie to get what they want. Some steal it when its owner isn’t looking. Then there are those who walk up to a target and explain the deal: give me what I want or bad things will happen to you. Call it “protection” or call it extortion, it is perhaps the most straightforward form of crime, favoured by the violent and the ruthless.

Most Cutthroats start out working in a preestablished gang, collecting fees and extracting payments on behalf of a boss. A small gang might be responsible for shaking down a handful of businesses, while the most powerful of crime lords may influence prominent cities or regions.

**Skill Proficiency:** Intimidation.
**Additional Equipment:** A kidskin bag of loaded dice, a snuff-box, a pocket watch that runs five minutes fast.

#### Underground Connections
Upon spending an hour asking around, and succeeding on a Charisma (Intimidation) check determined by the DM, you can prove your credibility and find a contact in a local gang, Thieves’ Guild, or underground network. This contact begins as friendly to you and will assist you with matters related to their criminal endeavours.

### Rank 1 - Tough
Working the impoverished regions of town, you’re a criminal who will mug those who walk down the wrong alley at night, or extort unwary travelers for safe passage along a road.

#### Holdings:
A hideout where you can seek shelter from the elements, and from local law enforcement.

#### Progression Example:
Acquire a building to use as a centre of operations for your illicit activities, and a handful of other criminals willing to follow your lead.

### Rank 2 - Crew Leader
Being the leader of your ragtag team comes with some nice perks. Shop owners shower you with gifts and praise in order to remain on your good side during your weekly rounds. Some will even go out of their way to source rare and valuable items that you require if they believe doing so will earn your favour.

#### Holdings:
A group of thugs that you command, overseeing their various ploys.

Knowledge of back alleys and slipways that allow you and your group to escape unpursued by local law enforcement.

A rundown establishment that you and your fellow henchmen operate out of.

#### Progression Example:
Your group of thugs has progressed in size to exert control over an entire village or district within a city.

A sizable collection of shop owners that you can regularly exploit for “protection”.

### Rank 3 - Gang Boss
You are now a big fish in a small pond, often butting heads with rival gangs. Your presence is not quite strong enough to force your competition out of your territory. Whether you make a bid for control or they do, one thing is for certain: there will be blood in the streets.

#### Holdings:
Multiple warehouses and business fronts to launder and store your spoils until a suitable buyer can be located.

A network of contacts that you use to acquire and sell illicit goods.

#### Progression Example:
You could overthrow a rival crime lord, or claim the territory of all surrounding rival gangs.

### Rank 4 - Crime Lord
You sit at the top of the criminal pyramid of your city or region. While there are still gangs that you don’t directly control, they know to stay well clear of your territory.

#### Holdings:
An expansive territory that you control, overseeing the criminal businesses within the city and taking a cut of their profits in exchange for protection.

A number of personal secrets and incriminating evidence about high-ranking nobles, clergy, or business magnates.

A corrupt, influential state official who does your bidding and provides you with confidential information.
