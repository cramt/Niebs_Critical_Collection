#Backgrounds
Burglars break into and steal from houses, storefronts, and warehouses, primarily operating out of major cities and ports. While thieving is a risky pursuit, the hardest part can be finding a buyer for rare and valuable items. The more unique the good, the more likely its original owner will want it returned, cutting your profit margin considerably.

Goods and valuables generally need to be sold through a fence: someone who will purchase your stolen goods, sell them to unknowing customers, and take a cut of your profits.

**Skill Proficiency:** Perception.
**Additional Equipment:** a grappling hook and rope, kidskin gloves, glass cutter, a vial of flour.

#### Surveillance
Upon spending an hour observing it, and successfully completing a Wisdom (Perception) check determined by the DM, you can map the general layout of a building. This includes the guard routes and rotation times, building entrances and exits, and the potential locations of valuables.

### Rank 1 - Snatcher
Breaking into homes in the lower end of town is generally your trade. Authorities only worry about civilians with the power to cause a stir; everyone else is on their own. Locks at this end of town are easy to pick if there is a lock at all. For the same reason, though, there is less to steal.

#### Holdings:
A safe house in the poor district used to store stolen goods and serving as emergency lodgings.

You have blueprints of a grand estate including secret entrances and passageways.

#### Progression Example:
Rob a well-to-do store in a reputable district, gaining notoriety and a big payday.

### Rank 2 - Burglar Specialist
Working in a team, while risky, allows for heists that would be beyond the reach of any burglar, no matter how skilled. Increasingly, when someone has an ambitious crime planned and needs to assemble a team of “the best,” they reach out to you.

#### Holdings:
A team of specialist thieves who operate under your instruction to execute more ambitious heists.

A contact working inside an establishment which you plan on robbing, who provides you information on the routine of the occupants, the location of valuable items, and escape routes.

#### Progression Example:
Membership in an established Thieves’ Guild in a major city or town.

### Rank 3 - Heist Master
Your skill as both a burglar and a leader has grown considerably over time. Whether by virtue of your own confidence or a message from the divine, you believe that you are capable of executing a major heist, with the right preparation and henchmen of course. Will it be a priceless painting you have been tasked with acquiring for a prospective buyer? A slovenly prince whose private affairs you seek to meddle in, having acquired his signet ring?

#### Holdings:
You hold a senior position in the Thieves’ Guild, instructing junior members in lockpicking, housebreaking, and evading law enforcers.

You uncover evidence of an attempted assassination on the life of a noble whose estate you robbed.

#### Progression Example:
Orchestrate a large-scale heist to rob the estate of a local noble.

### Rank 4 - Prince of Thieves
You have squirrelled away enough gold to live comfortably for the rest of your life. However, you now steal to satiate a greater motivation through the exchange of private information, blackmail, and the acquisition of rare and powerful artifacts.

After all, knowledge is power, and you’ve risen to a level where power is mandatory.

#### Holdings:
Your own estate with a household of staff, acquiring and selling rare and valuable items through your own circle of thieves, fences, and buyers.
