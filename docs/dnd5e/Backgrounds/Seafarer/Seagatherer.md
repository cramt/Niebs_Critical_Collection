#Backgrounds
The seas of Etharis are dangerous and forbidding. From mighty sea monsters to treacherous weather, most avoid the oceans at all costs. However, those that are skilled enough, or desperate enough, find a living harvesting what they can from the sea. Most Sea Gatherers represent the poorest of the poor. However, they make up for this lack of wealth with a savvy sense for survival, and Sea Gatherers who survive often become renowned heroes, known for fighting monsters of the deep and exploring sunken ruins of old. All know that an elderly Sea Gatherer must be a mighty figure indeed.

**Skill Proficiency:** Survival.
**Additional Equipment:** A bag filled with water weeds, a shellfish trap, a shucking knife, a pouch of bait, a straw sunhat.

#### Knowledge of the Seas
Upon spending an hour walking the shore, and succeeding on a Wisdom (Survival) check determined by the DM, you can find the best locations to hunt and catch sea treasures in the nearby region. This can range from simple fishing to dangerous monster hunting or diving for wrecks and ruins.

### Rank 1 - Dredge
You spend your days scavenging the ocean with nets and shellfish traps, hoping to make a living. You may be struggling with poverty, and scrounging by the coast is the only way you can survive. Perhaps you were born into a tradition of fishing, and have begun with humble origins. Regardless of your background, you hope to hone your skills and make something of yourself.

#### Holdings:
A small coracle fishing boat.

Knowledge of the best fishing spots in the area.

#### Progression Example:
Acquire a trawling boat and a commodity licence from a Harbour Master.

#### Rank 2 - Trawler
Your life begins as a master of waves, as you battle the ocean to attain its most prized treasures. A sturdier ship allows you to venture further and recover more (and more valuable) treasures from the sea. From whale oil to black pearls, you descend upon the seas with a fierce determination and a steely resolve.

#### Holdings:
A single-masted trawling boat with a few assistants to crew it.

A rumour of a great sunken treasure and the identity of who currently holds the map to it.

#### Progression Example:
Complete a contract to kill a particularly rare and dangerous nautical monster or find a sunken treasure. The contract must be completed for a wizard, merchant prince, or similarly influential individual.

### Rank 3 - Trawl Master
With a crew at your back, you have become renowned as one of the fiercest Trawlers alive. No catch is too dangerous, or prize too well-guarded beneath the waves. You are hired by powerful mages, wealthy merchants, and kings to retrieve exotic treasures from the ocean â€“ a task you perform with great prowess.

#### Holdings:
A deep-sea trawling boat, equipped to spend months at sea.

A team of expert trawlers and divers to assist you in adventures and maintain your boat.

The audience of wizards and merchant princes who wish to hire you.

#### Progression Example:
Slay a major sea monster or find a sunken treasure that becomes a legend. The event must draw the awe of influential individuals across the land.

### Rank 4 - Nautical Legend
Bards sing of the sea monsters you face and the storms you tame. It is said that even the Primordials of the tempest cannot deter you from your prize. All know that if there is a sunken ruin that needs plundering or an ancient sea creature that needs slaying, there is no one better suited for the task than you.

#### Holdings:
Control of a coastal island awarded to you by a Monarch in recognition of your feats. The island houses a fortress, guild house, or similar structure where nautical legends gather.

Repute across the land as a figure of legend.

A mighty weapon or artifact provided by a client or retrieved from sunken treasure.

An audience with any Monarch or head of state, at their convenience, to discuss matters of salvage and treasure hunting within the realm.
