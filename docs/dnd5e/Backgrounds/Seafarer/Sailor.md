#Backgrounds
Free from the gruelling class structures of the mainland, Sailors learn not to fear the laws of society, only the harsh temper of a storm and the stern discipline of a Boatswain. Sailors find talking to other seafarers second-nature and are often able to secure passage for themselves and their companions in exchange for their skills. For all sailors know, a man of the sea is a friend indeed.

**Skill Proficiency:** Perception.
**Additional Equipment:** Sturdy clothes, a large sack, dice, a liquor flask.

#### Sea Passage
Upon spending an hour in a port, and succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check determined by the DM, you can find a ship that you believe will provide free passage to a location of your choice, provided any ships are travelling to that location.

### Rank 1 - Deck Hand
You work on a sailing ship, performing menial labor such as tending the lines and tarring the deck. While your responsibilities are small, you may display a knack for a particular specialisation onboard the ship. You are at home on the waves, among your fellow sailors, regardless of the nature and business of the ship.

#### Holdings:
Free lodging on your boat.

Knowledge of a potential mutiny.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to Boatswain by a Captain.

### Rank 2 - Boatswa in
A Captain has chosen you as the Boatswain, responsible for the organisation and wellbeing of the crew, as well as ensuring their loyalty to the captain. You have also become a capable seafarer, knowing the ins and outs of running a ship with clockwork precision.

#### Holdings:
Command over the deckhands on the ship when not under the orders of a higher rank.

An officerâ€™s quarters which doubles as your cabin and living space.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to Ship Captain or become Captain of your own ship by other means.

### Rank 3 - Ship Captain
You are the undisputed master aboard your own ship. Your crew follow your every command (or suffer the consequences) and look to you for a vision of the future.

You now face such challenges as potential mutinies, provisions and payments for the sailors, and the delicate art of navigating dangerous seas.

#### Holdings:
Your own ship, or else have been entrusted with command of one, as in the case of a military ship provided by a nation.

Command of a loyal crew that see to the operation and maintenance of your ship.

If there is nobody above you in the chain of command, you have complete control of your ship, but you also have to pay for the upkeep. Even if the ship belongs to an admiralty or business interest, onboard the ship you are the one in charge.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to Admiral by a higher authority, or by obtaining a fleet of your own.

### Rank 4 - Fleet Admiral
You command a fleet of ships, whose captains are your subordinates and carry out your orders. The sailors sing shanties of your glory and you are known from port to harbour across the world. Your fleet contains an array of ships built for many different purposes, which you can assign as you see fit. You personally command the flagship of your fleet. What the future holds for you and the men sailing with you, is shaped by you and your command.

#### Holdings:
A fleet of ships that follow your every command.

Command of multiple loyal crews that see to the operation and maintenance of your fleet.

You are known in other lands for the tales of your victories and expertise.

Free lodging on any ship you are in command of, and any port or shipyard you are docked at.
