#Backgrounds
Docks represent the hubs that drive commerce, travel, and exchange of culture. In every one are teams of hardy workers who load goods and supplies onto and off of the ships. From lowly Clerks, who check off goods to and from warehouses, to the mighty Sealord bureaucrats, they keep the machinery of the docks moving.

**Skill Proficiency:** Investigation
**Additional Equipment:** A leather strap, 30 feet of rope, a pulley, a box of snuff, a clipboard and quill.

#### Liberate Ledgers
Upon spending an hour asking around, and succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check determined by the DM, you know the comings and goings of ships, wagons and merchandise at the trade hub you are exploring. You can similarly discern where different types of goods are stored in any warehouse, including the contraband.

### Rank 1 - Stock Clerk
Long days of tedious work await you as you check off goods as they are loaded and unloaded from ships to and from warehouses. Many Stock Clerks don’t last long as they are often blamed for broken or missing inventory. In your time you have learned a lot about the comings and goings throughout a dock, what types of ships and barrels typically come from where, and what their purpose is. You have learned who to ask the right questions, who holds the real power, and where to find a good time.

#### Holdings:
Lodging near the port or trade station you work at.

You know where the contraband is hidden and how to get in.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted to Customs Inspector by a dock worker of a higher station.

### Rank 2 - Customs Inspector
Your days of hard labour are behind you, as you are now charged with inspecting cargo for contraband, collecting tariffs, and filling ledgers of incoming and outgoing vessels. Corruption is rife at any port, and you are exposed to the shady deals, illegal goods, and criminal activities that take place there. It’s up to you whether you use your authority to enforce the law or just make sure you get a cut of the action.

#### Holdings:
A list of your fellow Customs Inspectors known for accepting bribes and forging ledger entries, and who bribed them.

A letter or clue revealing the smuggling operations of a criminal organisation.

Authority over low ranking dockworkers and port guards.

#### Progression Example:
Expose a large quantity of contraband or a criminal organisation.

### Rank 3 - Harbour Master
Your keen eye and efficient work in customs have earned you the rank of Harbour Master. You now preside over the dock of a harbour town or city. You set the local laws and regulations, governing the flow of trade and passage within your jurisdiction. All who wish to conduct business without hassle make sure they are on good terms with you, as nothing moves without your approval.

#### Holdings:
Comfortable accommodation within the port town or city of your station.

Authority of all resources, funding, and personnel of the harbour you manage.

The authority to grant commodity licences, allowing the import or harvesting of the commodity in the local area.

#### Progression Example:
Be promoted by a Monarch or state leader.

### Rank 4 - Sealord
Residing in the capital city of your region, you dictate the laws, taxes, and flow of sea commerce across the region.

As a Sealord, you are the undisputed authority in your region when it comes to all subjects related to the harbour.

#### Holdings:
Luxurious lodging near the mercantile district of the capital city where you oversee the operations of the region.

Control over docking fees and other charges associated with trading posts and ports across the region.

A seat at any council meetings pertaining to trade or the sea in the kingdom.
