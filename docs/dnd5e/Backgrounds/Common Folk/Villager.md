#Backgrounds
You hail from a small settlement like many others, populated mainly by subsistence farmers and local craftsmen. Common villagers look out for their own, typically because few would be willing to represent them. While lesser nobility regard you with disdain, fellow commoners recognise you as one of their own and are generous with their hospitality, provided there is enough to go around. They may request a few hours of light labour in exchange for short stays, if the host is a landholder. Commoners are also willing to share information with their peers that they would withhold from people of higher stations.

**Skill Proficiency:** Insight.
**Additional Equipment:** An iron pot, a shovel, a tinderbox.

#### Local Gossip
Upon spending an hour speaking to other commoners, and completing a Wisdom (Insight) check determined by the DM, you can learn of rumours, political intrigue, or other gossip related to a subject of your choice. This includes jobs and information people tend to hide from the authorities.

### Rank 1 - Peasant
Born to a landless farmer and his wife, you found work as a labourer on the estate of a local lord tilling fields, tending to animals, or milling grain for a meagre salary. While the work was punishing, it made you physically strong, capable of working for extended hours without fatigue.

#### Holdings:
A shack or hovel which you call home.

A deed to a heavily indebted farmstead which has been seized until its debts are cleared. You may have acquired this deed through inheritance, gambling winnings, or some other means.

#### Progression Example:
Clear the debt on your deed and restore your farmstead to operating condition.

### Rank 2 - Land Owner
You oversee a modest farm that produces various crops and small goods that you sell to local businesses and at markets for a modest profit. You have cultivated your reputation as an honest distributor among your customers, and a fair boss to the hired hands who help you manage your land.

#### Holdings:
A small farmstead, including livestock, crops, and stores suitable for the location.

Half a dozen unskilled hirelings who live and work on your farm.

#### Progression Example:
Become a respected and influential member of your local village.

### Rank 3 - Council Member
You have been elected to a seat on the local council, assuming a public role in the governance of your village. You and your fellow council members discuss matters of trade, infrastructure, keeping the peace, and placating the local lords. You receive complaints and resolve disputes among locals, reaching an amicable resolution where possible.

#### Holdings:
A skilled, professional hireling assistant. They may be a lawyer, accountant, or another expert who helps you manage your affairs.

Resources allocated by the Mayor for you to complete your duties as a council member.

#### Progression Example:
To be elected or appointed Mayor by a lord, council, electorate, or other means.
