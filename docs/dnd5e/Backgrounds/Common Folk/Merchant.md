#Backgrounds
Merchants are the lifeblood of trade and can be found anywhere from hawking goods in local marketplaces, to have established their own stores selling artisan wares. Merchants typically belong to a Merchant’s Guild and pay a yearly sum to register for protection by local law enforcement, though this varies by province. Merchants buy, sell, and trade wares of all sorts, knowing not just the price of everything but how to haggle that price up or down at will.
