#Backgrounds
Getting into the army isn’t the hard part, staying alive is. Every nation and culture has their own notions about what makes a good soldier, and who they look to fill their ranks.

As a soldier, you don’t just know to fight – you know war. Being a soldier involves much more than individual combat prowess. Winning a battle depends on discipline, teamwork, tactics, and a great deal of marching and logistical work that the epics rarely mention.

**Skill Proficiency:** Athletics.
**Additional Equipment:** A trophy from your first battle, a letter from your family or a loved one, standard-issue soldier’s garb, service medallion signifying rank.

#### Combat Drills
Upon spending an hour, and succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check determined by the DM, you can run training drills and gain an accurate estimate of the drilled humanoids' combat capabilities, as well as any equipment or fortifications they use.

You determine the most suitable strategy to improve their capabilities in the short term as well as the best way to train them for the long term.

### Rank 1 - Foot Soldier
Many Foot Soldiers are conscripts. Others fight for the honour of their king and country, and still others for the steady paycheck. Regardless of your reason for joining the military, the food was usually warm and the tents kept you dry during the long nights. Your time in the military has taught you the value of the regimented early mornings and working yourself to exhaustion.

#### Holdings:
A tent to sleep in and free food when in an encampment of your military.

A letter from a fallen enemy messenger that you either killed or found.

#### Progression Example:
Distinguish yourself. Bring vital information about an enemy encampment or movement that will help win a battle or prevent a defeat. Or perform exceptionally well in battle, turning the tide or capturing an enemy banner.

### Rank 2 - Sergeant
Your superiors have promoted you to the rank of Sergeant. This brings new challenges in training and commanding the new conscripts who have been assigned to you. How do you train them – on training grounds or in the wilds of Etharis? Or do you let them fend for themselves?

#### Holdings:
Command over a small unit of Foot Soldiers.

A valet who attends to your personal needs in the field and relays important messages when required.

#### Progression Example:
Maintain your troops’ discipline through multiple skirmishes.

### Rank 3 - Lieutenant
Several Sergeants have been placed under your command so that you can coordinate their movements in and out of battle. You maintain an air of command about you and instil confidence in those you command. You have also proven adept with battle tactics, knowing how to read an encounter and when to deploy reserves.

#### Holdings:
Command over a brigade of soldiers.

A command tent that serves as your headquarters for battlefield operations.

#### Progression Example:
Decisively win an even battle or win a battle against the odds.

### Rank 4 - Field Marshal
Your recent promotion to Field Marshal has been foreseen by many and scorned by few. You command whole armies at a time. Whether you are an artist with your masterful manoeuvring of battlelines, or utterly brutal in your encounters, none can deny your efficiency in war.

#### Holdings:
Command over the region’s military.

A seat at any council meetings relevant to military matters of the kingdom.

Residence in a manor close to the training grounds in the capital city.
