#Backgrounds
Free Swords are commonly referred to as mercenaries, taking jobs that the local forces can’t handle. Mercenaries may be the only hope of villages looking for defenders against raiders, overextended sheriffs chasing powerful fugitives, and small merchants travelling Etharis's dangerous byroads. Larger mercenary companies win wars on behalf of cities and kings. They fight for coin above all else, exacting little honour from the contracts they accept.

**Skill Proficiency:** Intimidation.
**Additional Equipment:** Moleskin gloves, grappling net, a hip flask of hard liquor.

#### Independent Contractor
Upon spending an hour loitering within a town, and succeeding on a Charisma (intimidation) check determined by the DM, your intimidating presence draws offers of employment to you. As long as you are not trying to conceal your presence, jobs befitting a Free Sword Mercenary will find you.

You can find mercenary and adventuring jobs only available to Free Sword licence-holders. These jobs typically pay more than a standard contract of their type. Free Sword guilds take a 5% cut as a guild fee.

### Rank 1 - Hireling
You have been trained in combat by a group of mercenaries with a Free Sword licence. After many tedious years of combat drills and shooting at straw targets, you are close to receiving your very own license.

#### Holdings:
Lodging at any Free Sword’s guild house and use of Free Sword’s training grounds and facilities.

The contract for a dangerous bounty that your mentor died trying to complete.

#### Progression Example:
Complete a contract with a guild member who has a Free Sword licence.

### Rank 2 - Sellsword
After proving your competence and trustworthiness, you have become a guildlicensed Sellsword. You start to receive specific requests for jobs as your reputation grows.

### Rank 3 - Sword Commander

The mercenary companions who accompany you on your jobs have matured into disciplined soldiers who trust you as their commander.

Your own private room in a guild house and a retainer who can either take care of business for you at the guild house or accompany you on your travels.

### Rank 4 - Battlelord
