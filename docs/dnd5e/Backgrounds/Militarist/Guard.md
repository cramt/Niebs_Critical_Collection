#Backgrounds
Public officers of the law in cities and large settlements, Guards protect the populace from the dangers both inside and outside the walls. If it looks like guards spend their time loitering and playing cards, its because most of the time the mere presence of a guard is enough to make petty criminals move along.

Guards occupy a variety of stations, ranging from lowly bar bouncers to royal men-at-arms who protect the royal family and their most prized possessions.

**Skill Proficiency:** Perception.
**Additional Equipment:** Manacles, pipe and tobacco box, a badge of office.

#### Informant
Upon spending an hour asking around, and succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check determined by the DM, you can find a contact within the local constabulary or guard hierarchy. This contact begins as friendly to you and will answer questions you have regarding local wanted criminals, law enforcement, and ongoing or previous investigations.
