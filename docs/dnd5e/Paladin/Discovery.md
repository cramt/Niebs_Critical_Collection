#Paladin
***The Oath of Discovery binds a paladin to the ideals of learning, teaching, and understanding. Often beginning their lives as simple scholars or researchers, paladins of this order strive to push the boundaries of understanding and enlightenment. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of knowledge, magic, and logic. Sometimes called Templars, they strive to learn and teach everything there is. While they might appear as nothing more than feverish researchers, one should not take them lightly. They utilize their vast pools of knowledge with great effectiveness in combat.***

### Tenets of Discovery
A paladin who takes up this oath often memorizes their tenets in multiple languages including lost and obscure ones.

***All Knowledge is Worth Knowing.*** There is no amount of information that is too small, or no secret too petty. I must learn all that I can about the world.

***Ignorance is a Sin.*** Educate those who do not have access to knowledge. And I will avoid – and thwart – those who stand in the way of the pursuit of knowledge.

***Secrets are the Foundation of All Existence.*** If there is a secret, I must learn it, for it could be the key to solving all of the mysteries of existence.

### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Ancient Teachings.*** As an action, you call forth knowledge long forgotten and imbue one weapon you are holding, using your Channel Divinity.

For 1 minute, you add your Intelligence modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon becomes covered in ancient runes and emits dim light in a 5-foot radius. 

If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

***Quick Study.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your ability to comprehend and understand things. As a bonus action, you gain the benefits of the [[dnd5e/Spell/Comprehend Languages\|Comprehend Languages]] spell and you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks for the next 10 minutes.

### Warrior of Knowledge
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can choose to utilize Intelligence instead of Charisma as your spellcasting ability and as the modifier for all your Channel Divinity, the number of spells you prepare, and Aura options.

### Divine Teacher
By 7th level, your supernatural ability to learn stretches to others around you.

At the end of every long rest, choose a single skill- or tool proficiency. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain proficieny with the chosen skill or tool.

The aura lasts until the end of your next long rest. 

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 

### Mind Fortress
Starting at 15th level, your knowledge of everything is so great that it makes you difficult to topple with mind-altering effects. 

You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

In addition, if a creature targets you with a spell or effect that requires an Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

### Peerless Student
At 20th level, your knowledge and quest for secrets is unmatched by most. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of divine flow that lasts for 1 hour. While in this state you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on initiative rolls.

- You gain resistance to psychic damage.

- When you use a spell or effect that requires a target to make a Wisdom or Intelligence saving throw, the creature does so with disadvantage.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.
