#Paladin
***The Oath of the Desperado is one that has a tendency to come and go throughout history, though there is perpetually a handful of members at the very least. Paladins who swear this Oath seek not to be a shining beacon of what's good and just, but what they believe to be right, whether that be because a god decreed it so, it's tradition to their people or simply a strongly held belief. As such, they are generally not recognizable by what they do, but their methods and drive.***

### Tenets of the Desperado
The tenets of the Oath of the Desperado exist amongst individuals, picked up and passed down through no set means. Members of this Oath often embody these key principles.

***Shoot First.*** Your justice is simple: whoever shoots and kills first is usually considered to be right.

***Teach Them Their Place.*** Those who step out of line against you should learn quickly where they belong.

***Be Steadfast.*** Never falter in what you believe is right; only go into something you're sure about.

### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:

***Divine Armaments.*** As a bonus action, you can summon a pepperbox that cannot misfire, along with 6 bullets for it. The weapon is summoned fully loaded, and it cannot use any other ammunition.

You get a bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and can divine smite on ranged attacks using it, provided that the enemy is within 60ft. At 11th level, this bonus extends to improved divine smite

The summoned weapon lasts until you use an action to dispel it, you expend all 6 bullets or you take a short or long rest.

***Reconstruct.*** As a bonus action, one firearm you are holding is automatically fixed if it was misfired but not broken, and that firearm is reloaded.

### Firearm Proficiency
Upon taking this Oath at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms and Tinker's Tools.

### Transcendent Justice

Starting at 7th level, you wield firearms with divine fury. When you hit an enemy that you are within 10 feet of with a firearm attack, you can ignore the restriction on using a melee weapon for divine smite.
 
At 11th level, this bonus also applies to improved divine smite.

At 18th level, you can smite if you are within 30 feet of the enemy, rather than 10.

### Experienced Duelist
By 15th level, you've learned to see the signs of when a fight is about to break out and how to act accordingly. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

### Bullet Time
At 20th level, a hectic situation is nothing out of the ordinary for you. As an action, you can slow your perception of time for 1 minute, granting you the following benefits:

* Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.
* You can use Reconstruct without expending a use of Channel Divinity.
* When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
* Your movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity.
