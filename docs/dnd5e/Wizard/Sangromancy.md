#Wizard
***You study an uncommon subschool of magic known as sangromancy or blood magic. Despite its dark reputation, there’s nothing inherently evil about the practice of sangromancy, though its demands on its practitioners are gruesome. As a sangromancer, your chosen magic demands more than knowledge—it demands sacrifice as well. Other wizards may view you with skepticism or even outright hostility, but none can deny the potency of your art.***

### Sangromancy Savant
Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, [[dnd5e/Spells/Sangromancy\|all sangromancy spells]] are added to the wizard spell list for you. In addition, the gold and time you must spend to copy a sangromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Full-Blooded
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a pool of d12s that you can expend instead of a hit die when you cast sangromancy spells. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your wizard level.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Sanguine Vigor
Starting at 6th level, your hit point maximum increases by 6 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

In addition, when you cast a sangromancy spell, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell.

### Blood for Blood
At 10th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a spell you cast, you can expend and roll a hit die, or a d12 from your Full-Blooded feature, to add its result to the damage dealt to that creature.

### Red Renewal
Starting at 14th level, when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended hit dice to recover. When you do, choose a number of expended hit dice equal to half your wizard level and regain them. You regain an equivalent number of dice from your Full Blooded feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
