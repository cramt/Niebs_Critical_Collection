#Wizard
***Wizards of the Grey Guild eschew the study of specific schools of magic in favour of an arcane speciality in duplicity and espionage. In some D&D worlds, all wizards of the Grey Guild belong to one organization with its own overarching goals and schemes while in other D&D worlds the Grey Guild is a style of wizardry exhibited by a number of isolated wizards or organizations. Regardless, wizards of the Grey Guild typically have a bad reputation amongst other wizards given their proclivity for memorizing and destroying spellbooks and hoarding secrets from rival spellcasters.***

### Destroy this Document
Starting at 2nd level, you memorize the content of your spellbook and do not need to reference a physical copy to prepare a spell. When you learn a new spell you spend the normal amount of time and gold to copy the spell but you commit it directly to memory rather than copying it to a book.

### Arcane Occultation
Starting at 2nd level, when you interact with a creature for less than one hour and it attempts to recollect particulars of its interaction with you it must succeed at an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or forget details of its interaction with you.

When a creature forgets the details of its interactions with you it cannot correctly identify your physical characteristics or the particulars of any conversation with or observation of you.

### Remote Surveillance
Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a saboteur’s stone.

After spending 1 minute in unbroken concentration, you can see and hear everything that happens within 30 feet of your saboteur’s stone so long as you are on the same plane of existence and continue to concentrate (as if on a spell) on the stone. During this time, you are blind and deaf in regards to your own senses.

While observing through the saboteur’s stone you can cast a single ranged spell as if you were in the stone’s location, after which the stone is destroyed. The stone is also destroyed when you use this feature to create a new saboteur’s stone.

### Practiced Conspirator
At 10th level, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice of the following: Deception, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth.

### Expendable Agents
At 14th level, you have learned to trust no one but yourself. That poses a problem for the spies of the Grey Guild so they learn to form a conspiracy of one.

As an action, you can expend a spell slot to to become a conspirator and create a number of additional conspirators equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

While under the effect of this feature you cannot cast a spell that requires concentration. Each conspirator appears in its own unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

Conspirators are indistinguishable from one another and from you. Each conspirator has your Armor Class, saving throws, and other attributes but evaporates into shadows and spiderwebs when they take any damage or are affected by any ability that inflicts a mental effect such as charmed or frightened. Each conspirator moves on the same turn but collectively can take only one action, one bonus action, and one reaction each round. When there is only one conspirator remaining, this effect ends and you become the remaining conspirator.

When you complete a long rest, you become a conspirator of your choice and all other conspirators evaporate.

You can use this feature again after you complete a long rest.
