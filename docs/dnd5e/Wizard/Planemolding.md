***The material plane holds an almost infinite amount of possibilities. Thousands upon thousands of years have shaped the landscape and the people that live there.***

***But for some people, even this much is not enough.
A select few study the countless small planes and demiplanes that exist. The focus here is not traveling and mapping the various planes, but discovering and utilizing small pockets of space and energy. This is the study of Planemolding.***

***While much of the magic overlaps with Conjuration, the main difference factor is the focus of the school. While Conjurers forcefully summon creatures to do their bidding, students of the School of Planemolding manipulate space itself to make room and shape worlds of their own creation.***

### Bottomless Palms
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you create a small personal pocket plane. As a bonus action, you can magically open small portals on the palms of your hands and store small objects in the plane. Creatures cannot be put into the plane this way.  Any object that is put inside the pocket plane can instantly be summoned using the same method.

The dimension is a 10-foot cube and has no light sources. It appears to be a room made from carved stone bricks and slabs. It always has enough oxygen to sustain life.

If you die, all objects and creatures inside the pocket plane are ejected forcefully from the palms of your hands and the plane is destroyed forever.

### Planar Jump
Starting at 6th level, before moving, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Your speed then becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.

When you use this feature, you can’t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.

### Planar Refuge
At 6th level, you can spend 1 minute and magically teleport yourself to and from your pocket plane. When you teleport out of your pocket plane, you return to the same spot you teleported from or the nearest spot closest to it if it's occupied.

### Planar Swipe
Starting at 10th level, your personal pocket plane grows and is now a 30-foot cube.
As an action, you can force a creature within 5 feet to make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.

If the creature is aware of you, they have advantage on the saving throw.
On a failed save, you touch one item the creature is carrying and forcefully teleport the item to your pocket plane. The item cannot be a piece of clothing or armor.

On a successful save, the creature can make a weapon attack against you as a reaction, as you stumble forward grasping nothing but air.

### Planar Student
Your study of planar magic has granted you with new spells and better ways of utilizing them.

At 13th level, [[dnd5e/Spell/Mordenkainens Magnificent Mansion\|Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion]] and [[dnd5e/Spell/Planeshift\|Planeshift]] are added to your spellbook, if you don’t already have them, and you can cast them as rituals.

At 15th level, [[dnd5e/Spell/Demiplane\|Demiplane]] is added to your spellbook, if you don’t already have it, and you can cast it as a ritual.

### Planar Molding
At 14th level, over the course of 1 hour and by expending one 8th or higher level spell slot, you can increase the size of your personal pocket plane or a demiplane you’ve created using the [[dnd5e/Spell/Demiplane\|Demiplane]] spell by a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your intelligence ability modifier (min. of 1).

By spending 12 hours and 1000 gold worth of magical components, you can change the appearance of your pocket plane or one of your demiplanes. Perhaps making it a field, a dense jungle, or a laboratory. Any items created inside your personal planes this way cannot be removed from their plane of origin.
