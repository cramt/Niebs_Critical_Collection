# ***Seems like you've managed to find a legacy subclass. This is no longer allowed in-game.***

***Wizards study magical power in all its forms, including the magic of psionics. Those wizards who follow the tradition of Psionics hone the magical potential of their own minds. Sometimes called psionicists or mentalists, these wizards interact with the multiverse through the lens of their psionic aptitude and awareness.*** 

***Psionicists channel their magic by focusing their minds. By doing so they can transcend their physical bodies, adopting forms of pure thought, casting spells psionically to bypass the need for components, and perceiving the world with a broader range of senses.***

***As a member of the Psionics tradition, you might have awoken your psionic potential through the strain of your esoteric studies, or perhaps you joined a scholarly order dedicated to unlocking the magic of the mind.***

### Psionic Focus
2nd-level Psionics feature

You have learned to channel psionic energy through a special object: a psionic focus. You gain the object with this feature.

While your psionic focus is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

- The object is a spellcasting focus for you.

- When you roll psychic or force damage for any of your wizard spells, you can reroll any of those damage dice that rolls a 1, but you must use the new roll.

If your psionic focus is lost, you can magically recreate it by meditating for 1 hour during a short or long rest, at the end of which the focus appears in your hand.

### Psionic Devotion
2nd-level Psionics feature

Your study of psionics begins to unleash your mind’s potential. When you gain this feature, choose one of the following cantrips: [[dnd5e/Spell/Friends\|friends]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Mage Hand\|mage hand]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Message\|message]]. You learn that cantrip if you don’t already know it, and it doesn’t count against the number of wizard cantrips you know.

While your psionic focus is on your person, you can cast the chosen cantrip as a bonus
action, requiring no components, and with the modification listed below:

***Friends.*** When the spell ends, the target doesn’t become hostile to you.

***Mage Hand.*** You can make the hand invisible when you cast the spell, and controlling the spell is a bonus action for you.

***Message.*** You don’t need to point toward the target or whisper your message out loud.

### Thought Form
6th-level Psionics feature

While you are carrying your psionic focus, you can use a bonus action to magically transform your body into pure psionic energy. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to assume your normal form, or until you are incapacitated or die.

While in thought form, you are a figure of luminous psychic energy, with your psionic focus hovering within. Your form can appear as
anything you wish, but it is obviously magical, is the same size as you, and sheds dim light in a 5- foot-radius. Any other equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you and melds into your thought form. You also gain the following benefits:

**Psionic Spellcasting.** When you cast a spell while in thought form, you can cast the spell psionically. If you do so, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.

**Psychic Resilience.** You gain resistance to psychic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

You can transform using this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Mental Discipline
10th-level Psionics feature

Your mind’s power expands to greater heights. When you gain this feature, choose one of the following spells: [[dnd5e/Spell/Dominate Person\|dominate person]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Scrying\|scrying]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Telekinesis\|telekinesis]]. You can add the spell to your spellbook, and you can cast it without components.

You can also cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot. After you do so, you regain the ability to cast the spell without a slot when you finish a long rest.

### Empowered Psionics
10th-level Psionics feature

When you deal psychic or force damage with a wizard spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage against one of the spell’s targets.

### Thought Travel
14th-level Psionics feature

While using your Thought Form, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If you return to your normal form while inside an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.
