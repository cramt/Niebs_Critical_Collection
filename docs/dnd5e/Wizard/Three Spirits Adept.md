#Wizard
***Wizards who forgo specializing in schools of magic to become a Three Spirits Adept are uncommon. Three Spirits Adepts are typically from regions where wizards are a more rural and isolated tradition rather than gathering in universities or major cities. A three Spirits Adept forms a powerful bond with their familiars and learns how to evoke their otherworldly nature in a way other magical traditions cannot.***

### True Familiar
Starting at 2nd level, you learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]] spell. You do not expend a spell slot to cast the spell, you do not have to prepare the spell to cast it, and you do not need to use spell components to cast it.

When you cast the spell for the first time and choose what creature type your familiar is (Celestial, Fey, or Fiend), your choice is permanent and cannot be changed on subsequent casts.

### Creature Mystique
Starting at 2nd level, your familiar has a single spell slot that it can expend to cast a spell it knows.
 
On your familiar’s turn, you can choose to expend its spell slot to cast a spell of that level or lower from your familiar’s spell list. Your familiar uses your spell attack modifier and spells it casts use your spell save DC. If the spell requires concentration you must concentrate on it.

Which spells your familiar can cast depends on its type;

||~ Celestial |
|Spell Level |Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Bless\|Bless]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Enhance Ability\|Enhance Ability]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Magic Weapon\|Magic Weapon]] |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Aura Of Vitality\|Aura of Vitality]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]] |

||~ Fey |
|Spell Level |Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Dissonant Whispers\|Dissonant Whispers]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Faerie Fire\|Faerie Fire]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Invisibility\|Invisibility]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Moonbeam\|Moonbeam]] |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Conjure Animals\|Conjure Animals]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Fly\|Fly]] |

||~ Fiend |
|Spell Level |Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Bane\|Bane]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Inflict Wounds\|Inflict Wounds]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Darkness\|Darkness]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Enthrall\|Enthrall]] |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Fear\|Fear]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Hunger Of Hadar\|Hunger of Hadar]] |

Your familiar’s spell slot level is equal to the highest level spell slot you have but no higher than 5th level.

Your familiar regains its spell slot when you take a long rest.

### Shape of the Spirits
Starting at 6th level, you can cast the spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Polymorph\|Polymorph]] once without expending a spell slot or any components to take on any of the forms listed in the find familiar spell.

Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### Otherworldly Expression
Starting at 10th level, on your familiar’s turn you can command it to invoke the ultimate expression of its mystical nature once as its action. The exact power varies based on the type of familiar you use this ability on. You can use this feature again after a long rest.

***Celestial.*** Until the end of your next turn all allies within 10 feet of your familiar gain advantage on saving throws and resistance to all damage.

***Fey.*** You can teleport each friendly creature within 30 feet of your familiar to any unoccupied space within 30 feet of your familiar.

***Fiend.*** All enemy creatures within 10 feet of your familiar must make an Intelligence saving throw. If they fail, they lose all resistances and they gain vulnerability to all damage types they are not immune or resistant to until the end of your familiar's next turn.

### Three Spirits
Starting at 14th level, you can have two familiars at a time, changing the normal rules of the [[dnd5e/Spell/Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]] spell.

When you create your second familiar, choose what creature type it is (Celestial, Fey, or Fiend), your choice is permanent and cannot be changed.

Both familiars have their own spell slot granted by the Creature Mystique feature.
