# In-Game
### What is Multiclassing?
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.

Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

### Why should I Multiclass?
Multiclassing is an excellent choice to add more flavour and cool mechanics to your characters. Keep in mind, you will often end up weaker than other "pure" characters, but instead, be more versatile.

Remember, you should always have an in-game reason to multiclass. A reason for your character to change up their style.

### Why shouldn't I multiclass?
Of course, always ask your dm before you want to multiclass.

Generally, multiclassing is a good option, but sometimes, it's not the right fit and some classes are better suited for it.

For example:
* Suddenly multiclassing into a Sorcerer won't make sense out of the gate. Suddenly gaining magical powers out of nowhere often feels cheap. However, it could be a good choice, if something dramatic happened to your character. Perhaps they were just barely killed by a dragon's breath, and some of the magical energies got infused into their body.

* Becoming a Cleric, Paladin, or Warlock out of nowhere. All of these classes have some sort of patron they follow, and therefore some setup has to be made first. Perhaps your character found religion in dire times, or perhaps they made a dark bargain with a devil.

Again these are just examples, to illustrate to point I'm trying to make.

Always consider why your character would be multiclassing before you do it. Simply wanting a strong build is not enough reason to do it.

# Rules For Multiclassing
### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for **both** your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.

For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher.

Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

||~ Multiclassing Prerequisites |
|Class |Ability Score Minimum |
|---|---|
| [[dnd5e/Artificer\|Artificer]] | Intelligence 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Barbarian\|Barbarian]] | Strength 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Bard\|Bard]] | Charisma 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Blood Hunter\|Blood Hunter (MM)]] | Strength or Dexterity 13 and Intelligence 13 |

| [[dnd5e/Cleric\|Cleric]] | Wisdom 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Druid\|Druid]] | Wisdom 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Fighter\|Fighter]] | Strength or Dexterity 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Monk\|Monk]] | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Mutant\|Mutant (Homebrew)]] | Constitution 13 and Strength or Dexterity 13 |
| [[dnd5e/Paladin\|Paladin]] | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |

| [[dnd5e/Wizard\|Wizard]] | Intelligence 13 |

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together.

For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10, so if you are a Paladin 5/Fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a Paladin 5/Cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a Fighter 3/Rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

||~ Multiclassing Proficiencies |
|Class |Proficiencies Gained |

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

#### Channel Divinity
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it.

You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a Cleric 6/Paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses.

Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the Fighter's version of Extra Attack does).

Similarly, the Warlock's Eldritch Invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

#### Unarmored Defense
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes.

Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below.

If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

##### Spells Known and Prepared
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class.

If you are a Ranger 4/Wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level Ranger spells based on your levels in the Ranger class. As a 3rd-level Wizard, you know three Wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

##### Spell Slots
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the Mutant, Paladin, and Ranger classes, half your levels (rounded up) in the Artificer or Spellblade classes, and a third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight, Left Hand (Guild), or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, **but only to cast your lower-level spells**. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned Ranger 4/ Wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.

However, **you don't know any 3rd-level spells**, nor do you know any 2nd-level Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Another example, A Bard 1/Sorc 4 knows two Bard cantrips, four Bard spells (up to 1st level), five Sorcerer cantrips and five Sorcerer spells (up to 2nd level). This is because a level 4 Sorcerer would only be able to pick up to 2nd level spells, according to the Sorcerer table.

They each also have to resolve those spells known from the ground up, following the normal rules for gaining another spell known and be able to change an existing new spell each time they level up, up to a spell level the class can learn at the time.

For instance, the 'Sorcerer 4' can't just say "I know five spells and have access to both 1st level and 2nd level spells, I decide I know five 2nd level spells", since they can only change one per level (and has only had access to 2nd level spells for two character levels), so at the most, they could have four 2nd level spells and a single 1st level spell.

**TL;DR** Treat each level up in a casting class as if you are a single class character (only counting the levels in that class). Then reference the multi-class spell slots chart to find out what spell slots you have. You can use these slots with all of your classes.

| 20th | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

##### Pact Magic
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the Warlock Class or Bloodhunter Profane Soul Subclass, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

If multiclassing Order of the Profane Soul with Warlock levels, add a third of your Blood Hunter levels (rounded down) to your Warlock level and consult the Warlock progression table for total Spell Slots, Cantrips known, and Spell Slot Level.


##### Blood Magic
When multiclassing with classes that have Blood Magic, such as the [[dnd5e/Blood Mage\|Blood Mage (Guild)]], you can use blood magic to cast spells gained from other classes, but no spells cast with blood magic from another class may restore hit points in any way, including effects like revivify and resurrection. The level of spells you can cast with blood magic is dictated by the Max Spell Level you have in the class that has the blood magic feature. You can also cast spells learned with blood magic with normal spell slots, with the exception of sangromancy spells.
