#Hobgoblin
***War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal.***

### Hobgoblin Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.

- **Alignment.** Hobgoblin society is built on fidelity to a rigid, unforgiving code of conduct. As such, they tend toward lawful evil.

- **Size.** Hobgoblins are between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Martial Training.** You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor.

- **Saving Face.** Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

#### Brightnose Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins are sometimes born with bright red or blue noses. This attribute is thought to be a sign of potency and potential. Blue- and red-nosed hobgoblins receive preferential treatment, and as a result they occupy most of the leadership positions in hobgoblin society.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Last-Ditch Effort.** A Brightnose has to defend its rank against many competitors, and this constant duelling has honed your reflexes to sharpen when the end of the fight draws close. When you are reduced below half your maximum hit points, you gain +1 AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest. 

#### Sunscorch Hobgoblin
Ancient priests of the Sunscorch tribe of hobgoblins developed divine rituals that allowed them to take on draconic characteristics. The original tribe has long since disappeared, but the traits created by these rituals linger in the hobgoblin race. Sunscorch Hobgoblins appear much like their fellows, except for their brilliant azure eyes. The birth of a sunscorch hobgoblin is considered a powerful omen. When a sunscorch hobgoblin isn't leading a warband or tribe, it is likely the voice of wisdom behind its leader.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

- **Dragon's Adaptations.** You have resistance to fire damage.

- **Wyvern's Tongue.** You can speak, read, and write Draconic.

#### Koalinth (Sea Hobgoblin)
Sleeker than their ground-dwelling cousins, Koalinth have webbed fingers and toes, and they have gill slits in their necks. Their skin is light green and covered with patches of dark green, aqua, or blue hair. Their faces have been compared to seals', and large male koalinth have enlarged noses like elephant seals. Male koalinths also share the aggressive behavior and loud bellow of elephant seals.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Water Adapted.** You can breathe air and water, and have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

- **Underwater Wrestler.** You have advantage on Athletics checks while you are submerged.
