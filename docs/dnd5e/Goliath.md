#Goliath
***At the highest mountain peaks dwell the reclusive goliaths, wandering a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.***

#### Cloudborn Goliath
Descended from the cloud giants, cloudborn goliaths feel most comfortable in the highest reaches of the tallest mountains, where the cold and thin air would make it impossible for most creatures to survive. Few cloudborn goliaths ever leave their mountain homes, but those that are struck with wanderlust have been known to become captains of renown, or warriors of great strength. Cloudborn have pale tones of grey or blue skin, vibrant blue eyes and walk with a light, almost regal step, compared to the heavy footsteps of most goliaths.

- **Ancestral Mist.** By focusing yourself, you can make the air near you fill with clouds. You can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Fog Cloud\|fog cloud]] spell once with this trait, requiring no material components. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a short or long rest.

- **Unclouded Vision.** Living in the highest peaks has trained your eyes to see beyond the fog that would mar other's sight. You can see through an area covered in fog or mist as though it were only lightly obscured, provided that the mist is natural or originates from a spell you are casting.

- **Nimbus Resistant.** Cloudborn Goliaths can withstand a thunderstorm while inside the cloud itself. You have resistance to thunder damage.

#### Fireborn Goliath
Owing their fiery hair and skin markings to fire giant ancestors, Fireborn Goliaths are often militaristic and wild, forging tools of war and battling for the right to be the most respected warrior in the clan. Fireborn are at home in both warm and cold climates through a kind of internal heat that sustains them. Most Fireborn have grey, brown, or reddish skin, burning orange or red eyes and feel warm to the touch.

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. 

#### Frostborn Goliath
Born in the coldest highlands, the progeny of frost giants, Frostborn Goliaths are even among goliaths particularly well suited to extreme cold. The icy, thick white hair and blue-white skin of the Frostborn lends them great resillience to the chill winds of the northlands, and too the beasts and warrior clans that patrol it. When a Frostborn Goliath focuses their energy, their cold skin rapidly hardens up and creates a sharp chill that surrounds its body.

- **Cold Resistance.** Your frost giant ancestry and life in the frigid highlands has given you resistance to cold damage. Icewalker. You can move across difficult terrain made of ice or snow without expending extra movement.

- **Glacial Durability.** If an enemy within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack and you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by a number equal to your Constitution Modifier and reduce the enemy's movement speed by half until the end of their next turn. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) per long rest. 

#### Hillborn Goliath
Standing with a gaping, dripping mouth, and often eating anything that will come close enough, Hillborn Goliaths are the least trusted of goliaths, and are the most common type to leave the tribes, whether by choice or by force. Hillborn Goliaths often find their way to the city to enjoy good food, good company, and a good fight. They have tan or brown skin, dark brown eyes and hair and are known to devour creatures and objects alike.

- **Universal Digestion.** Your hill giant heritage gives you advantage on saving throws against poison and disease. You may also consume most items as though they were food. You can eat 1lb of items per round. For every 4lbs of items you eat, you gain the effects of having eaten 1lb of food and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to not become poisoned until you finish a long rest. You cannot digest magic items.

- **Dripping Maw.** Your ancestry manifests as an unhinged jaw that can open wide and bite deep into your enemy. Your bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it you deal 1d4 piercing damage and deal additional acid damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Hungry Jaws.** In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your Dripping Maw. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Stoneborn Goliath
Sturdy, unwavering, and nigh immovable, stoneborn are a force to be reckoned with on their homeland in the mountains or any battlefield littered with stones. Their rough, deep gray skin is the sturdiest of all goliaths, and their empty gray-white eyes leave many haunted. Tossing stones at a distance, then rolling large boulders down a mountainside to crush a foe is their favored tactic.

- **Stonebound Footing.** While standing, if you would be pushed or pulled, you may instead move 10 fewer feet in the direction you were being moved.

In addition, while standing you have advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, pushed, or pulled.

- **Stone's Endurance.** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Boulder Toss.** If you make an improvised ranged weapon attack with a stone you can lift, you may add your proficiency bonus to that attack. Use your Strength modifier instead of Dexterity for ranged attacks and damage when attacking with a stone. Use the following table to determine how far you can throw a stone, and the damage it deals. You can wield stones up to 50 lbs. with one hand-- this increases to 150 lbs. at 8th level.

|Radius in Inches |Approximate Wight (LBS) |Throw Distance |Damage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 600 | 0/10 | 2d6+2 |

| Smaller | 15-45 | 40/40 | 1d4 |

#### Stormborn Goliath
Raised in the chill waters of the northern seas, stormborn, with their green-tinged hair and solid green eyes often rise quickly through the clan’s leadership, and most think themselves superior to all other goliaths. Their bravery in combat is nearly unmatched and stormborn chieftains will fight alongside their brothers and sisters in battle, leading the charge with speed, and a sword of lightning.

- **Lightning Quickness.** Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet.

- **Storm's Fury.** If a creature within 30 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to strike at them with a bolt of lightning. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier, or half as much on a successful save. The creature has disadvantage on the save if it is wearing metal armor. You can use this trait a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.

- **Storming Weapon.** If at least one of your hands is free you can use your action to create a weapon made of wind or lightning, it lasts 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.
