### The Basics
Creating a character is most often the most complex thing a player has to do during a campaign, and can therefore seem very daunting to many players. Not only is there a lot of things to keep track of during creation, but players also have a vast amount of different options to pick from, often leading to analysis paralysis.

Players can sometimes forget to develop their characters during creation, focusing too much on backstory and the mechanics of it all, forgetting *who* their character actually is at the core. A lack of backstory or dissonance between story and class can also lead to a character feeling rushed or unfinished. All of this can cause problems and inconsistency during play.

The biggest takeaway you should get from reading through this guide is the fact that all facets, like backstory, race, class, and personality, of a character, are important and having an imbalance can throw a character off. However, it is also important to remember that you do not have to get every single detail of a character *just* right. Gaps can be left to be filled in during play, and you won't always have the answers to every single question about your character before you've had a chance to play them.

By reading through this guide, you will be equipped with all the tools you need to create and play a character perfect for both you and your group.

### Using This Guide
This guide is split into different sections, each explaining a different facet of character creation and play. The sections are ordered going from the first step of creation to the last step. However, this does not mean you could not complete the steps in an alternate order, perhaps having a great backstory before knowing anything about class, but instead serves as the preferred option if you're starting from a blank slate.

You'll be asked a lot of different questions in each section, but not all questions have to be answered necessarily. Most are meant to get you thinking and considering new sides of the character you're creating, hopefully deepening them. If you choose to consider or answer any of the questions posed, remember to write down a few words to ensure you don't forget.

Some sections will also provide methods and tools for you to better communicate and collaborate with your DM and other players during creation. Being specific in your questions can often lead to better results, and will most often make it easier for others to help you whenever you're unsure.

Sections will also often include tables with different options. These tables are not meant to limit your choices, but instead, serve as inspiration or to speed up the creation process.

Some sections will focus more on the rules, while others focus more on creative writing and concepts.

As you progress through each section, you can always go back and change what you did in earlier sections. Perhaps answering a question about your character's class inspired you or changed something related to their backstory or perhaps you simply had a better idea. Don't be afraid to erase or redo parts, as this will only serve to make your character better in the end.

**Some steps will also include house rules as seen elsewhere on this wiki. These rules might not apply to your game and you should always check with your DM first. Whenever such a rule becomes relevant, it will be pointed out, such as being tagged with (Homebrew).**

**TL;DR:** The following sections will be a comprehensive guide, but you can choose to skip any part of each individual section or do sections in any order you prefer.
