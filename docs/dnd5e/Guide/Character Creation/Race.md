#Guide
### Overview
Every character belongs to a race or lineage, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player races are dwarves, elves, halflings, humans, and tieflings. Some races also have **subraces** such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.

Each race and lineage is detailed on the [[dnd5e/Races\|Races and Lineages]] page.

### Your Choice
While some races lie closer to each other than others, they all differ from each other in some aspects.

#### Ability Score Increase
Each race, lineage, and most subraces offer an increase to one or more of your ability scores. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Whichever scores you increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

#### Appearance
Consider how members of your race usually appear, and how your character might be similar or different from their peers. Do they look like an average person of their heritage? Are they a social outcast because of their appearance? What traits sets your character apart from the rest, if any?

#### Racial Features
The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in other important ways, by granting you certain natural abilities and certain special talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's race or lineage grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, languages, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes.

For example, the racial traits of Lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high levels tend to be powerful wizards.

Often playing against the type can be just as much fun, if not more and you should never feel pigeonholed into going with certain race and class combinations.

#### Languages
Your character's race often includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually common and the language of your ancestors. If you gain a language of your choice, you can choose a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.

Consider how your character picked up any additional languages. Is it a part of their cultural heritage? Did they study the language? Did they know someone who spoke it?

#### Consider Your Class
The combination of your chosen class and race or lineage can in of itself be an interesting character. Consider if your chosen class falls in line with your race or lineage, or if it doesn't. What situations might occur from a disconnect? Is your character aware or insecure about the fact that they might not fit into a certain stereotype? Is your character proud of being different? Is your character content with following the norm and expectations?

### Lineages
Lineages differ slightly from normal races. You can choose to start with a certain lineage at 1st level or you can replace your race with a lineage during a campaign if deemed appropriate for the story. Lineages can be combined with races, giving a character its own unique spin on the lineage.

#### Using Lineages
At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. Alternatively, you can choose a lineage. If you choose a lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you aren't any longer. You now possess only your lineage's racial traits.

When you create a character using a lineage option, follow these additional rules during character creation.

#### Ability Score Increase for Lineages
When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.

#### Lineage Languages
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.

### Creature Type
Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identify the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented tells you what your character's creature type is. If an option does not provide a creature type, your character has the Humanoid creature type.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the [[dnd5e/Spell/Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]] spell specifies that the spell doesn't work in a creature of the Construct type.

### Customizing Your Origin (Optional)
Certain races might not work with your current character concept mechanically and the concept that therefore sometimes be difficult to fully realize. The following subsections address that issue of by adding choice to your character's race, allowing you to customize it to better fit your concept.

Character race one the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.

#### Ability Score Increase
You can choose to forgo the ability score increase from your chosen race and subrace or lineage and instead increase an ability score of your choice by 2, and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. None of the scores can be raised above 20.

#### Languages
To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.

#### Proficiencies
Some races and lineages grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culture in question or might have pursued different training.

You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.

||~ Proficiency Swaps |
|Proficiency |Replacement Proficiency |
|---|---|
| Skill | Skill |
| Armor | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Simple weapon | Simple weapon or tool |
| Martial weapon | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Tool | Tool or simple weapon |

#### Personality
The description of a race might suggest various things about the behavior and personality of that people's archetypal adventurers. You may ignore those suggestions, whether they're about alignment, moods, interest, or any other personal trait. Your character's personality and behavior are entirely yours to determine.
