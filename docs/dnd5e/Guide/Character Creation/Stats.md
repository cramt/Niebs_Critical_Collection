### What are Ability Scores?
Most of what your character does in the game depends on their six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**.

They define who and what your character is, and what they're capable of. Are they dexterous and charming? Perhaps they're intelligent and strong?

The three main rolls of the game, the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll, rely on the six ability scores.

### Determining the Scores
Before figuring out the specifics of how strong, dexterous, or cunning your character is, you first have to determine what your ability scores are. There are three common methods of doing so: rolling, point buy, or the Standard Array.

Once you have determined your ability scores utilizing one of the three methods, you may put them in any of the six abilities you deem appropriate for your character. In this way, you determine what the physical and mental characteristics are for your character.

#### Rolling Ability Scores
The most common way to determine a character's ability scores is by rolling. Due to its very nature, it can create very powerful characters as often as it creates less powerful characters.

When rolling your ability scores, you roll four six-sided dice, or commonly referred to as 4d6, and record the total of the highest three dice. You do this **six** times in total. For example, you roll 4d6 and roll the following: [[dnd5e/5,\|4, 3, 3]]. You would then remove the lowest number, in this case [[dnd5e/5,\|4, 3, --3--]] and your total would end up being **12** (5 + 4 + 3).

#### Point Buy
If you don't want to leave your ability scores up to chance but still want some level of input, you can use the point buy system. It functions in a similar manner to many modern RPG video games.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial or feat-specific increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.

||~ Ability Score Point Cost |
|Score |Cost |
|---|---|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

For example, this method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones [[dnd5e/15,\|15, 15, 8, 8, 8]], a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal [[dnd5e/13,\|13, 13, 12, 12, 12]] or any set of numbers between those extremes.

For easy of use, you can choose to use [[dnd5e/5e Point Buy.html\|this]] tool. Use the standard settings.

#### Standard Array
Using the standard array means you just distribute the scores among your character's six abilities. It requires no rolling or other input from you. It is therefore the fastest way of determining your ability scores and can be useful when having to create a character quickly. The standard array is as follows: [[dnd5e/15,\|14, 13, 12, 10, 8]].

### The Six Abilities
Below each of the six abilities a character has is described to help you with what scores might suit your character best. Deciding how to spread out your six determined ability scores is always up to you.

#### Strength
**Measures:** Natural athleticism, bodily power
**Important for:** Barbarian, fighter, paladin
Strength is, as the name might suggest, one of the simplest scores to define. It determines your character's physical power and might, how much they can carry, how much damage they do with large weapons, etc.

#### Dexterity
**Measures:** Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise
**Important for:** Monk, ranger, rogue
Dexterity determines how quick and nimble your character is. How well they dodge attacks and roll out of the way of rolling boulders.

#### Constitution
**Measures:** Health, stamina, vital force
**Important for:** Everyone
Constitution is at the core of many characters. It determines how much health a character has and how resistant they are to disease, among other things.

#### Intelligence
**Measures:** Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill
**Important for:** Bloodmage, spellblade, wizard
Intelligence the measure of how quickly a character can learn new things, recall information, and draw connections between information.

#### Wisdom
**Measures:** Awareness, intuition, insight 
**Important for:** Cleric, druid
Wisdom is your character's awareness of their surroundings and the people around them. It helps with determining truth and uncovering things hidden from plain sight

#### Charisma
**Measures:** Confidence, eloquence, leadership 
**Important for:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock
Charisma determines your character's confidence in themselves. It often takes the form of good social skills, but can more broadly be defined as having a strong belief in one's own abilities.

### Ability Modifiers
Depending on an abilities score, it has a certain ability modifier as seen on the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 for the ability score and then device the result by 2 (round down).

||~ Ability Scores and Modifiers |
|Score |Modifier |
|---|---|
| 1 | -5 |
| 2-3 | -4 |
| 4-5 | -3 |
| 6-7 | -2 |
| 8-9 | -1 |
| 10-11 | +0 |
| 12-13 | +1 |
| 14-15 | +2 |
| 16-17 | +3 |
| 18-19 | +4 |
| 20-21 | +5 |
| 22-23 | +6 |

### Scores Create Character
After distributing your ability scores among the six abilities, it's time to consider how they appear in-game. Consider what having a high score might look like and how it defines the character you're making. Do they rely heavily on that skill? Was it inborn or did they train to get there? Did they neglect other aspects of themselves and focused on that one skill too much?

**Example:** A wizard who has a high Intelligence and high Charisma, might be extremely confident in their magical abilities, sometimes to the detriment of others.

Its also important, if not more important, to consider your character's low scores and how they present themselves. Are they ashamed of what they lack in certain areas? What problems arise from having a low score? Are they working to improve their deficits?

**Example:** A fighter who has low Dexterity and Constitution scores might be clumsy and sickly. This might make them meek and attempt not to stand out or get into trouble.
