### What are classes?
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features**- capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of *proficiencies*: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

### Choice Matters
Your character's class is in some sense a lens through which to see the game world. You channel your character's desires and goals through their special abilities, often achieving their wishes in surprising ways.

#### The Classes
Below the traditional archetype for each class is described. You might choose to have your character follow along with their class' archetype, or you might have them break the mold. Consider asking your DM how the different classes fit in their world and how people perceive them.

How does your character fit into their class? Where did they learn the skills to become a member of their class? Did they become a member of their class by choice or not?

#### Level
Most adventures start at 1st through 3rd level. A 1st through 3rd level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although they might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st through 3rd level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're an experienced player or if you're joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM might have you starting as a higher-level character, signifying that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

#### Class Features
Each class provides a character with special class features and abilities. Remember to write them down starting at first level. Consider how your character learns new abilities in the game world.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your character's hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. You also add your Constitution modifier to your starting health. This is also your **hit point maximum**.

Record your character's hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points.

Whenever you gain a level, your hit points maximum increases by a number equal to a roll of the Hit Die of the class you're taking a level in + your Constitution modifier to a minimum of 1 hit point added total.

### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +1 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet:

* Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with
* Attack rolls using spells you cast
* Ability checks using skills you're proficient in
* Ability checks using tools you're proficient with
* Saving throws you're proficient in
* Saving throw DCs for spells you cast

Your class, background, and race determine your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and your skill and tool proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other numbers more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.
