### What this Rule is
Adventurers are most often outliers in society since they are the ones that delve head-first into danger, risking life and limb. To reflect this, taking feats can be a good option.

### What are Feats?
Feats are special features that add abilities, resources, or something different to your character. They often reflect some special skill a character has trained in or something they generally excel at.

Many feats have certain prerequisites your character must meet before being able to take them, such as race, proficiencies, and spellcasting. You gain also gain feats as you level up, detailed in each class description.

All the feats are detailed on the [[dnd5e/Feats\|Feats]] page.

### 1st-level Character Feats
Every character can choose a feat at 1st level. You cannot choose any of the feats where you get a penalty to hit and then add damage. Always remember to ask the DM when choosing a feat. You do not gain an additional feat when multiclassing into a new class. You also gain no feats from races, subraces, or lineages when using this rule.

Consider why your character might have a given feat. Have they trained all their lives to master certain weapons? Is it something that comes from their culture or backstory? Did they pick it up out of necessity? Does it complement or contradict their race and class?
