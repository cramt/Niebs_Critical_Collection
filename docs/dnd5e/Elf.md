#Elf
***Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.***

### Elf Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 75, and can live to be 250 years old.

- **Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

- **Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

- **Trance.** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.

#### Dark Elf
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Drow Magic.** You know the [[dnd5e/Spell/Dancing Lights\|Dancing Lights]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Faerie Fire\|Faerie Fire]] once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Darkness\|Darkness]] once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

- **Drow Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.

- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

- **Superior Darkvision.** Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.

- **Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

#### Eladrin
Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:

**Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.
**Winter** is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.
**Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.
**Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.

Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.

When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.

The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.

- **Fey Step.** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The effects are as follows:

**Autumn.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.

**Winter.** When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Spring.** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

**Summer.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Avariel Weapon Training.** You are proficient with the javelin, spear, shortbow, and longbow.

#### Celadrin
Celadrins are a subrace of elf related to eladrin, and touched by the plane of fire. Celadrin are gifted with a beautiful voice, and filled with a natural warmth and wanderlust. They are rarer than other elves, and are typically found in communities of high elves. Free-spirited like the flame, they are more chaotic than most other elves, and value their freedom more than most.

You do not require somatic components when casting the spell in this way, and the spell emerges from your eyes. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Ignan. 

#### Lythari
Lythari are true lycanthropes, elves given the ancient curse of the werewolf through a ritual of transformation, or a birth to lycanthropic parents. Unlike their parents, Lythari do not transform into a hybrid of humanoid and wolf, instead possessing a true wolf form. Lythari are almost exclusively found in wood elf lands roaming in packs. Lythari have shaggier hair, sharper teeth, and more pointed ears, making them more animalistic looking than their wood-elf cousins. Though they may share in the curse of lycanthropy, unlike a werewolf or similar creature, the bite of the lythari does not spread their curse.

- **Elven Weapon Training.** You are proficient with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow and longbow.

- **Wolf Shape.** You can use your action to polymorph into a medium wolf, or back into your true form. Your statistics are the same in each form, except your wolf form’s AC is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you, becoming part of your wolf form, and your corpse transforms back into your true form if you die while in your wolf shape. You cannot speak or cast spells while transformed.

While transformed, your sharp teeth become a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your bite you deal 2d4 piercing damage and if the target is large or smaller you can use your bonus action to force the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. The damage of your bite increases to 2d6 at 11th level.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Gnoll.
