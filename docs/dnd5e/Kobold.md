#Kobold
***Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.***

- **Alignment.** Kobolds are fundamentally selfish, making them evil, but their reliance on the strength of their group makes them trend toward law.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Dragonwrought Kobold
You were born a Dragonwrought kobold, proof of your race’s innate connection to dragons, and through a gruelling rite of passage awoke your powers. A kobold who undergoes this rite must first endure nine days of fasting. Immediately thereafter, they must enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. When the rite is complete, their scales harden, wings sprout from its back and a sorcerous talent is awoken deep within.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1. Alternatively, you can choose to have altered base statistics; if you do so, your Strength score does not decrease by 2.

- **Hardened Scales.** You have tough, dragonlike scales that reflect the light around you. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

- **Dragon’s Blast.** Different colors of Urd find a different sorcerous talent is awoken through the rite. You know one of the following cantrips: [[dnd5e/Spell/Produce Flame\|produce flame]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Acid Splash\|acid splash]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Frostbite\|frostbite]]. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Choose which cantrip you know at the time of character creation

- **Wrought Wings.** You gain a flying speed of 30ft. You can fly only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft. You cannot fly if you are encumbered, wearing medium or heavy armor, or a backpack not specially tailored to your wings.

#### Lickspittle Kobold
Being consistently underestimated is seen as a gift for the Lickspittle—one they have taken advantage of for generations. Kobolds are intimately aware of both their shortcomings and their strengths. If the biggest hurdle a kobold faces is their lack of strength, then that’s no obstacle at all. The moment a kobold accepts its physical weakness, the more powerful it can become through means other than brute force. In the world they occupy, kobolds are often bullied and enslaved by larger creatures. Lickspittle Kobolds tend to take to this role, starting at the bottom rung of society and climbing up slowly and carefully, making the most out of what little they are given.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Grovel, Cower, and Beg.** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Little Jester.** You have learned to swallow your pride and survive by groveling, placating, and amusing the powerful. You gain proficiency in the performance and deception skills.
In addition, you can also use your **Grovel, Cower, and Beg** trait when dealing with important individuals. For one minute you and any allies that can see and hear you gain advantage on performance, persuasion, and deception rolls against non-hostile creatures of a higher status than the members your party.

- **Emergency Retreat.** Whenever you are below your maximum hit points and you take damage or an opponent's attack misses you, you can use your reaction to move up a number of feet up to your walking speed away from the attacker or source of the damage. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this feature twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Pitstalker Kobold
Among Pitstalkers, traps are an art form. Few artisans are as obsessed with the minute details of their work as a master kobold trapmaker. Kobolds rarely indulge in creativity over function, but exceptions are made for a cunning trap. They find ingenious ways to incorporate bizarre spells, technological advances, and unexpected twists into their traps. They are also known to carve complex tunnels in caves they inhabit, becoming gauntlets of ever more intricate and elaborate traps.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

- **Expert Tunneler.** As a Pitstalker, you are naturally suited to digging. You gain a burrow speed of 5. The holes you normally dig are about three feet in diameter. Burrowing through solid rock or most buildings instead takes 10 minutes per 5 feet and requires a pickaxe or similar tool.

- **Naturally Stealthy.** Kobolds often try to hide behind their larger allies for survival. You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

- **Trapcrafting.** You have advantage on rolls made to detect, create, or disarm traps. In addition, when a trap you have built is activated, add +3 to the DC of any saving throw to avoid or resist its effects.
