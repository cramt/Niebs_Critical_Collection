#Barbarian
***While guns are often pictured being wielding by calm rangers and cool-headed desperados, some take this archetype and flip it on its head. Preferring to instead charge into the middle of the fray and decimate their enemies with a cloud of lead before they have any time to react.***

### Gunzerker Training
When you select this path at 3rd level, you have been trained or taught yourself the basics of powder-based weaponry. You gain proficiency with Firearms.

Additionally, you can add your Rage damage modifier to damage rolls made with Firearms while raging.

### Frenzied Fix
At 3rd level, if you misfire with a weapon and the weapon isn't outright destroyed or broken, you can expend a use of your Rage to repair the firearm as a bonus action.

### Improvised Beating
Starting at 6th level, your familiarity with certain firearms allows you to utilize them in more, unorthodox, ways.

You become proficient in using Firearms as melee weapons and use your Strength for attack and damage rolls when using them this way. One-handed firearms deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and two-handed firearms deal 1d12 bludgeoning damage when utilized in this fashion. Strangely, the weapons seem to take minimal damage and still function properly after being used in this manner.

### Raging Inferno
At 10th level, the size of large weapons no longer slow you down. You can wield Firearms that normally require two hands to operate in one hand with no penalties. Additionally, you can reload and repair your firearms even when you have a firearm in each hand.

Additionally, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

### Hail of Lead
At 14th level, you can momentarily enter a state of calm and proceed to fire with inhuman speed.

As an action, while raging, you can make a number of ranged weapon attacks using any firearms you are currently wielding, up to a number of attacks equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If you misfire on any of the attacks, the misfire is ignored and the attack simply misses. When this action is complete, your Rage ends and you cannot enter a Rage until the beginning of your next turn.

You can use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.
