#Barbarian
***Some, be it by choice or circumstance, manage to unveil the secrets of the multiverse. Discovering what's hidden in plain sight, seeing catastrophic futures to come, or learning of the countless horrors outside the mortal realms.***

Such a barbarian might have learned the truth by choice, by happenstance, or some other way. You can choose the origin of your knowledge or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Outsider table.

### Forbidden Magic
When you reach 3rd level, you learn to utilize some of the forbidden knowledge you've gained and can use this to cast spells from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Warlock\|Warlock Spell List]].

You can only cast a spell gained from this feature with yourself at the target, or as the centre of the effect. You may choose one of the spells you learn at 3rd level to be favoured. When a spell is favoured in this manner, it ignores the restriction and can be cast as normal. You may choose an additional spell you know and favour it at 7th (2 total), 13th (3 total), and 19th (4 total) level.

For the purposed of feats, and features from other classes, this feature counts as having the Pact Magic feature.

#### Spell Slots
The Outsider Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots are; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Armor Of Agathys\|armor of agathys]], you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Warlock\|Warlock Spell List]].

The Spells Known column of the Outsider Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the warlock spells you know with another spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Warlock\|Warlock Spell List]]. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

### Maddening Truth
When you choose this path at 3rd level, the forbidden truth has augmented your rage. You no longer necessarily enter a state of anger, but instead momentarily recall horrible images, futures, visions, and more.

While raging, you can cast and concentrate on spells gained from your Forbidden Magic feature. When entering a rage, you can cast one of the spells granted by your Forbidden Magic feature with a casting time of one action or bonus action, as part of the bonus action to enter the rage

Additionally, you have resistance to psychic damage while raging, in addition to your other resistances.

### Hardened by Knowledge
At 6th level, your learnings have required you to strengthen your mind substantially. You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make that uses your Arcana skill.

### Revalations
At 6th level, you uncover more hidden facets of reality and bend them to your will. You gain two Eldritch Invocations of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Warlock/Invocations\|list of invocations]].

When selecting an invocation, your "Warlock level" is considered to be equal to half of your Barbarian level (rounded down). If the chosen invocation casts a spell, you must have a spellslot of the appropriate level or higher. You forego any Pact requirements of invocations.

You can cast any spells gained this way and maintain concentration while raging.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

Starting at 10th level, your "Warlock" level is equal to your Barbarian level when determining what invocations you can choose.

### Truthseeker
At 10th level, you can delve deeper into the madness. You can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Contact Other Plane\|contact other plane]] spell without using a spellslot or material components. When casting the spell, you can choose to target an entity on the same plane of existence as you, up to the dm's discretion. If you fail your Intelligence saving throw, you immediately enter a rage before taking the psychic damage, in addition to the spell's other effects. The rage lasts until your next long rest, unless you fall unconscious.

After you cast this spell, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Truthspreader
At 14th level, you seek to spread the knowledge you've gained, often leading to the deaths of those around you. Whenever you use your action to attack with a weapon, you can cast one of the spells granted by your Forbidden Magic feature as a bonus action.

Additionallly, you cannot lose concentration on spells cast using your Forbidden Magic feature while raging.
