#Barbarian
***For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end â€“ that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.***

*This is a set of optional class features for the Berserker Barbarian subclass. When you reach 3rd level in the base class, you can choose the default subclass features or go with the subclass features listed below.*

### Frenzy
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, as a free action, you can go into a frenzy while raging. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns.

While in a frenzied rage, you are also immune to all effects of exhaustion, including death from 6 levels of exhaustion.

If you have gone into a frenzied rage, you suffer one level of exhaustion when your rage ends.

### Body over Mind
Starting at 3rd level, your body begins to adapt to the severe strain you put on it. You can decrease your exhaustion by one level at the end of a short rest, provided you've consumed a meal and have not worn armor during the rest.

Starting at 10th level, whenever your exhaustion level would be decreased by any means, it is reduced by an additional level.

### Mindless Rage
Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Frenzied Strikes
Starting at 10th level, your rage sometimes becomes too much for your body to handle.

Whenever you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can forgo advantage for your attacks and make an additional weapon attack for each of your attacks.

When you use this feature, you gain a level of exhaustion and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC = 10 + your exhaustion level. On a failed save, your rage ends.

### Retaliation
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

If you used your Reckless Attack and/or your Frenzied Strikes feature on your turn, this attack also benefits from those features.
