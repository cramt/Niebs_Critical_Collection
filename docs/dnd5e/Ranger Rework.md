#RangerRework

***Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.***

***This is an optional rework for the Ranger. The intent is to make the class stand more on its own and bring it up to the same level as the other classes, hopefully without going too far. It is recommended only for experienced players. The rework is made using original content and inspiration from various sources.***

*You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

# Class Features
As an ranger, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per ranger level
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
**Tools:** None
**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Wisdom
**Skills:** Survival, and choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, and Stealth.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor
- (a) two shortswords or (b) one martial weapon and one simple melee weapon
- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

### Master Tracker
Starting from 1st level, you are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency in Survival.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

### Stalker
Your time spent in the wilderness has prepared you to hunt all manner of prey. Beginning at 1st level, when you succeed on a Survival check to detect a trail left by one or more creatures, you gain advantage on Perception checks to track down those creatures. In addition, you may add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls against creatures that you have tracked with your Survival skill.

At 6th level, you gain advantage on Stealth rolls against creatures that you have tracked with the Stalker feature.

### Natural Explorer
You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:
* You ignore nonmagical difficult terrain.
* You have advantage on initiative rolls. 
* On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness.
You gain the following benefits when travelling for an hour or more:
* Nonmagical difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### • Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### • Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

#### • Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### • Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

### Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

#### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Ranger\|ranger spell list]].
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.

### Primal Awareness
You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

||~ Primal Awareness Spells | 
|Ranger Level |Spell |
|---|---|
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Speak With Animals\|Speak with Animals]] |
| 5th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Beast Sense\|Beast Sense]] |
| 9th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Speak With Plants\|Speak with Plants]] |
| 13th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Locate Creature\|Locate Creature]] |
| 17th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Commune With Nature\|Commune with Nature]] |

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Ranger Conclave
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave:
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Beast Master\|Beast Master]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Fey Wanderer\|Fey Wanderer (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Gloom Stalker\|Gloom Stalker]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Horizon Walker\|Horizon Walker]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Hunter\|Hunter]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Monster Slayer\|Monster Slayer]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Primeval Guardian\|Primeval Guardian (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Swarmkeeper\|Swarmkeeper (UA)]]
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Landstrider
Starting from 6th level, you also ignore magically created difficult terrain. You can also pass through nonmagical hazards without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar danger.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against magically created or manipulated terrain to impede movement, such as that created by the [[dnd5e/Spell/Entangle\|Entangle]] spell.

### Fleet of Foot
You learn new ways of utilizing your surroundings to aid your movement. Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Fade Away
At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1),  and you regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

### Vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Hawkeye
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Your Wisdom modifier is added to your attack rolls.
