#Bugbear
***Bugbears rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring to operate at night. When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing, and bully weaker creatures into doing their bidding. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and lethargy.***

### Standard Bugbear Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Age.** Bugbears reach adulthood at age 16 and live up to 80 years.

- **Alignment.** Bugbears endure a harsh existence that demands each of them to remain self-sufficient, even at the expense of their fellows. They tend to be chaotic evil.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Long-Limbed.** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

### Variant Bugbears
#### Chameleon Bugbear
Replaces your **Powerful Build** and Long **Limbed traits.**

Through an evolutionary anomaly, magical crossbreeding experiment, or the curse of some god, some bugbears are somewhat reptillian, and can change their color like a chameleon. A chameleon bugbear looks much like a normal bugbear, except for its long, prehensile tongue and its color changing hair and skin.

- **Color Shift.** If you have moved 0 feet this turn, as a bonus action you may alter your colors to blend in to your surroundings. As long as you remain in place, or move slower than half your walking speed on each of your turns, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in terrain that matches your color.

- **Chameleon Tongue.** You have a long reptilian tongue that allows you to grab and manipulate objects. You can use your tongue to interact with items up to 5 lbs as though it were a third hand. You cannot attack with the tongue.

#### Strangleclaw Bugbear
Replaces your **Long Limbed** trait.

Bugbears that lack the long arms of their brethren are often born with powerful claws. These are the deadly Strangleclaw bugbears, barbaric and broad chested, with more beastly looking features than most of their kin. Their claws are able to hold creatures by digging deep into their flesh. Strangleclaws are respected among their brethren, and often rise to the top to become the leaders of goblin and bugbear raiding parties.

- **Claws.** Your sharp claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your claw, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Grasping Claw.- **While you are grappling a creature, you can use your bonus action to make a single unarmed strike with your claws against the grappled creature. Additionally, if you surprise a creature and deal extra damage with your Surprise Attack trait, you can use your bonus action to make a special melee attack, a grapple, against that creature. If you succeed the grapple check, the grappled creature has disadvantage on attempts made to escape your grapple.

#### Worghest
Replaces your **Powerful Build** and **Long Limbed** traits.

Descended from a barghest and a bugbear, worghests are extraordinarily rare, and are regarded with fear and respect in the goblinoid tribes where they dwell. They possess the ability to change shape into a wild beast resembling a wild barghest or a wolf. These bugbears also retain their barghest parent’s glowing eyes and ability to devour the life energy of slain foes.

- **Wolf Shape.** You can use your action to polymorph into a medium wolf, or back into your true form. Your statistics are the same in each form, except your wolf form’s AC is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you, becoming part of your wolf form. Your corpse transforms back into your true form if you die while in your wolf shape.
While transformed, your sharp teeth become a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your bite you deal 2d4 piercing damage and if the target is large or smaller you can use your bonus action to force the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. You cannot speak or cast spells while transformed. The damage of your bite increases to 2d6 at 11th level.

- **Devour Essence.** Once per day, when you are within 5 feet of a slain humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 minute, you can use your bonus action to feed upon the flesh and life essence of the creature. When you feed in this way you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the creature's CR (minimum 1).
