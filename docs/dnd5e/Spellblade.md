# Class Features
As a Spellblade, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Spellblade level
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Spellblade level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light Armor, Medium Armor
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons
**Tools:** None
**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Stealth, and Persuasion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) two martial melee weapons or (b) a longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows
- two simple weapons
- (a) leather armour or (b) scale mail
- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Arcane Weapon
At 1st level, you learn to magically bind weapons to yourself. You can spend an hour inscribing arcane runes onto a weapon you are proficient with, which can be done during a short or long rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and transform it into an Arcane Weapon. You may have up to two weapons inscribed in this way at once. While inscribed, a weapon gains the following benefits:

* The weapon requires attunement and can only be attuned to by you. While attuned to the weapon, it takes up no attunement slots. However, if you inscribe a magical weapon that requires attunement normally, the weapon takes up an attunement slot as normal.

* When inscribing a weapon, choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. The Weapon becomes infused with that element and its damage type becomes that of the new element. Additionally, it counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity.

* If your Arcane Weapon lacks the two-handed property, and you are wielding it in one hand with another hand free, then you gain a magical +1 bonus to your AC. If you use two hands to make an attack with your Arcane Weapon, then you lose this magical bonus until the start of your next turn.

* You can't be disarmed of the weapon unless you are incapacitated.

* You use it as a spellcasting focus for your Spellblade spells.

* If your Arcane Weapons are within a mile of you, you can summon one or both as a bonus action on your turn, causing them to teleport instantly to your hands.

* If your Arcane Weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour to magically repair the weapon.

Weapons inscribed this way remain inscribed until you die or you inscribe a third weapon. When inscribing a third weapon you must choose another inscribed weapon to have its runes removed, which will happen magically no matter the other weapon's location.

### Spellcasting
At 1st level, you have learned to cast arcane magic through study, much like a wizard. You've studied the battle application of magic and inscribed your chosen weapons with a handful of spells to augment your fighting style. You channel your magic through your Arcane Weapons, which appears to others as if you're producing magical wonders as you fight.

#### Weapon Required
You produce your spellblade spell effects through your blade. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically your Arcane Weapon or another weapon-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Spellblade\|spellblade spell list]]. You learn additional spellblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellblade table.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Spellblade\|spellblade spell list]].
The Spells Known column of the Spellblade table shows when you learn more Spellblade spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spellblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Spellblade\|spellblade spell list]], which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spellblade spells since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Fighting Style
By 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your speciality. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### • Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### • Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

##### • Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

###### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Arcane Step
At 2nd level, you can teleport around the battlefield. As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. At higher levels of this class, the teleportation distance increases to 20 feet at 5th level, 25 feeet at 11th level, and 30 feet at 17th level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend a spell slot to use this feature again.

### Blade Magic
Starting at 2nd level, you can seamlessly blend your magic and bladework. After you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 20th level, you can use this feature an unlimited number of times.

### Arcane Discipline
At 3rd level you choose your arcane discipline, which determines the philosophical school that shapes your search for perfection in both the martial and arcane arts:
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Beacon\|Beacon]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Chronoknight\|Chronoknight]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Duplicitist\|Duplicitist]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Elementalist\|Elementalist]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Guardian\|Guardian]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Impaler\|Impaler]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Marksman\|Marksman]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Meteor Knight\|Meteor Knight]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Necroblade\|Necroblade]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Runefist\|Runefist]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Runeshot\|Runeshot]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Runesmith\|Runesmith]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Shrapnelist\|Shrapnelist]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Skirmisher\|Skirmisher]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Spellslinger\|Spellslinger]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Swordmage\|Swordmage]]
- [[dnd5e/Spellblade/Whirlwind\|Whirlwind]]
Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

#### Discipline Spells
Each discipline has a list of associated spells. You learn these spells at the levels specified in the discipline description. Once you learn a discipline spell, it doesn't count against your number of spells known.

If you gain a discipline spell that doesn't appear on the Spellblade spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Spellblade spell for you.

#### Aegis
Your spellblade discipline gives you a powerful dweomer called an Aegis. Each Aegis provided by your discipline explains how to use it. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Aegis again.

The saving throw DC for your Aegis effects is equal to your spellblade spell save DC.

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your Aegis twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Harness Arcane Power
At 3rd level, all spellblades gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Arcane Restoration:** As a bonus action, you regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature per long rest is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Versatility
Starting at 4th level, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial and arcane practice:

* Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to spellblades.

* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Spellblade\|spellblade spell list]].

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Greater Blade Magic
Starting at 5th level of this class, after you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same action without expending a use of Blade Magic.

### Arcane Techniques
Starting from 6th level, you learn new ways of combining swordplay with spellcasting. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher with a casting time of 1 action, you can make one weapon attack with an Arcane Weapon as a bonus action.

Additionally, you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have a weapon or shield in both hands.

### Unbroken Focus
Starting at 10th level, controlling spells during combat has become second nature to you. If you take an instance of damage less than or equal to your Intelligence score, you do not need to make a concentration check to maintain a Spellblade spell you are concentrating on.

### Dimensional Cantrip
By 11th level, immediately before or after you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see as part of the same action.

### Spell Parry
At 14th level, when you see a creature within 60 feet of you cast a spell, you can use your reaction to interrupt their spell with your weapon. The spell must target only a single creature within 15 feet of you. Make a weapon attack roll against the caster's spell save DC. On a success, the caster's spell fails and has no effect.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Master of All
At 18th level you become a master of melding magic and might. Your Intelligence and either Strength or Dexterity (your choice) ability scores increase by 2, and you can raise the abilities over 20.
