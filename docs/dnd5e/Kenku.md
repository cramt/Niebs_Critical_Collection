#### Harrowfeather Kenku
Those who know of them call them Harrows. The Harrowfeather scour the battlefield for a greater purpose. No one knows who or what drives them to the grisly life of a reaper, but all who are born of the Harrowfeather commit themselves to the mirthless duty of ensuring that those who die stay that way. They see their duty as most honorable and tenaciously hunt the undead. They rely on their medical expertise to save the living from disease as they believe that those who die of disease will carry their illness into the afterlife.
