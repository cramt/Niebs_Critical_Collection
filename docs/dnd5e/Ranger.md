#Ranger
***Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.***

*You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

- (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons
- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Deft Explorer
Starting from 1st level, you are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.

#### Canny (1st level)
Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill.

You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.

#### Roving (6th level)
Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Tireless (10th level)
As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

### Favored Foe
At 1st level, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### • Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### • Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

##### • Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### • Druidic Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Druid\|druid spell list]]. They count as ranger spells for you, and
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace
one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

##### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

##### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### • Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

### Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

#### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Ranger\|ranger spell list]].
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

### Primal Awareness
You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

||~ Primal Awareness Spells | 
|Ranger Level |Spell |
|---|---|
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Speak With Animals\|Speak with Animals]] |
| 5th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Beast Sense\|Beast Sense]] |
| 9th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Speak With Plants\|Speak with Plants]] |
| 13th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Locate Creature\|Locate Creature]] |
| 17th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Commune With Nature\|Commune with Nature]] |

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Ranger Conclave
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave:
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Beast Master\|Beast Master]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Drakewarden\|Drakewarden]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Fey Wanderer\|Fey Wanderer]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Gloom Stalker\|Gloom Stalker]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Green Reaper\|Green Reaper (GH)]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Horizon Walker\|Horizon Walker]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Hunter\|Hunter]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Monster Slayer\|Monster Slayer]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Primeval Guardian\|Primeval Guardian (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Swarmkeeper\|Swarmkeeper]]
- [[dnd5e/Ranger/Vermin Lord\|Vermin Lord (GH)]]
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Martial Versatility
Starting at 4th level, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Greater Favored Enemy
At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game.

Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

When you gain this feature, you also learn two languages of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemies or creatures associated with them. However, you are free to pick any languages you wish to learn.

### Fleet of Foot
Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Nature's Veil
At 10th level, you can draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favoured enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
