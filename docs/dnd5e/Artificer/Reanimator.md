#Artificer
***Most artificers prefer to work with chemicals or metals, but you work with flesh and bone. Other artificers are known to push boundaries in pursuit of magical advancement, but you transgress even those limits. These differences have resulted in your unique ability to manipulate the states of life and death. Others may believe these states are static, but to a reanimator they are dynamic—what is living may die, and what is dead may live again.***

### Tool Proficiency
Starting when you choose this speciality at 3rd l evel, you gain proficiency with surgeon’s tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

*New Artisan Tool: Surgeon’s Tools (GH)*
*Surgeons tools include scalpels, syringes, a vial of a mild sedative, three rolls of gauze, and a bonesaw. These tools weigh 5 lbs and cost 25 GP.*

### Reanimator Spells
Beginning at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Reanimator Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### Modern Prometheus
Your transgressive experiments with life after death have borne fruit, and you have created a composite golem. It’s friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Composite Golem stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Your composite golem is covered in the stitches and staples necessary to keep the various body parts it’s composed of attached to one another.

In combat, the golem shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. If you are incapacitated, the golem can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the [[dnd5e/Spell/Mending\|Mending]] spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your surgeon’s tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The golem returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new composite golem if you have surgeon’s tools and spare parts with you. If you already have a golem from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The composite golem also perishes if you die.

#### **Composite Golem**
*Medium Construct*

**Armor Class:** 11 + PB (natural armor)
**Hit Points:** 5 + five times your artificer level (the golem has a number of Hit Dice [[dnd5e/D8s\|]] equal to your artificer level)
**Speed:** 30 ft.
**STR** 16 (+3) **DEX** 8 (-1) **CON** 15 (+2) **INT** 8 (-1) **WIS** 11 (+0) **CHA** 6 (-2)
**Saving Throws:** Str +3 plus PB, Con +2 plus PB
**Skills:** Athletics +4 plus PB, Intimidation -2 plus PB x 2
**Damage Resistances:** Lightning, necrotic, poison
**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, exhaustion, poisened
**Senses:** Passive Perception 10 + PB

**Proficiency Bonus (PB):** equals your bonus

##### Actions (Require Your Bonus Action)
***Slam.***  Melee Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + PB bludgeoning damage.

##### Reactions
***Grounding Bolts.***  When the golem takes lightning damage, it gains temporary hit points equal to the damage it takes. As part of the same reaction, a creature within 30 feet of your golem must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your artificer spell save DC or take lightning damage equal to the temporary hit points gained. On a success, the creature takes half as much lightning damage.

### Macabre Modules
Also at 3rd level, you can upgrade your composite golem in your idle time. When you finish a long rest, choose two macabre modules from the list below. Your golem gains the benefit of these modules until you use this feature again. Starting at 9th level, you can choose three macabre modules when you finish a long rest.
***Adamant Staples.*** Your composite golem’s weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistances. In addition, the golem has resistance to damage from critical hits.
***Beastial Components.*** Your composite golem incorporates animal components to enhance its abilities. While this module is installed, your golem’s base movement speed increases by 10 feet, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) ability checks that rely on scent, and it has darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet.
***Electric Touch.*** Your composite golem can cast the shocking grasp cantrip. When it casts this cantrip, it uses your spell attack modifier, counts as your level for the purposes of the cantrip’s damage scaling, and scores a critical hit on a result of 19 or 20 on the attack roll.
***Growth Hormone.*** Your composite golem’s size increases to Large. Its maximum hit points increase by 2 per level you have in this class.
***Iron Knuckles.*** When your composite golem hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw with a DC of your artificer spell save DC or be pushed 5 feet or knocked prone (your choice).

### Enlivening Discharge
At 5th level, when your composite golem is within 60 feet of you, you can use an action to fire a bolt of empowering energy at it. When you do, it gains the following benefits for the next minute:
* It gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* It regains a number of hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus at the start of each of its turns.
* Its slam attack deals an additional 1d10 lightning damage.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Reanimate Dead
At 9th level, you always have the [[dnd5e/Spell/Animate Dead\|Animate Dead]] spell prepared and can cast it without expending a spell slot. It counts as an artificer spell for you and does not count against the maximum number of spells you can prepare. When you cast the spell, the creature type of the skeletons or zombies created changes from undead to construct and has resistance to lightning damage.

Once you cast this spell without expending a spell slot, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you create a construct with a spell, one can be created with a macabre module of your choice. Only one construct other than your Composite Golem can have a macabre module at any given time.

### Spark of Life
Starting at 15th level, your understanding of the role that electricity has in starting and stopping life has led to improved outcomes. When you cast an artificer spell that restores hit points or deals lightning damage, roll 2d6 and add the result to the amount healed or lightning damage dealt by the spell.
