***This is a set of optional class features for the Battle Smith Artificer subclass. They replace the Steel Defender and Improved Defender class features and add an additional feature. When you reach 3rd level in the subclass, you can choose the default class features or go with the class features listed below.***

### Tool Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 

### Battle Smith Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### Battle Ready
When you reach 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:
- You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
- When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls. 

### Steel Protector
By 3rd level, your tinkering has granted you a special suit of armour.

The armour is split into three sections, being a helmet, a chest and arm piece, and a leg and boot piece. You decide the armour's appearance.

While the armour itself is considered magical, due to the specialized nature of the armour you can infuse the individual pieces of the armour. However, you cannot have two active infusions of the same type on the armour at once.

To gain the full benefits of the armour and be able to attune to the armour, a wearer must wear all 3 sections and have proficiency with medium or heavy armour. While the armour may be split into 3 pieces, it only requires one attunement slot.

While wearing the armour, the wearer has disadvantage on stealth  (dex) checks.

All infusions put on the armour itself forego their attunement requirements.

While attuned to the set, the armour grants its wearer an AC of 13 + your intelligence ability modifier (Min 1).

The armour additionally has a number of maximum charges equal to your proficiency bonus. As an action, and by expending one charge, the wearer gains 2d4 + 2 temporary hit points that last 1 hour. The armour regains 1d6 + 1 charges every dawn.

### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Energy Reserves
At 9th level, you learn to expand your use of the Protectorâ€™s energy reserves.

When attuned, you can use one action to expend any number of remaining charges. You then regain a single expended spellslot with the same value as the number of charges spent.

For example, you can use an action and expend 3 charges of the armour to regain a single spent 3rd level spellslot.


### Arcane Jolt
At 9th level, you learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When you hit a target with a magic weapon attack you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:
* The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
* Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you
can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Improved Protector
At 15th level, your Arcane Jolt and Steel Protector become more powerful:
* The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane jolt both increase to 4d6.
* Whenever the wearer expends any number of charges of the Steel Protector armour, any number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) of their choice within 30 feet that they can see takes 2d4 + 2 force damage.
