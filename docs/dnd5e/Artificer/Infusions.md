#Artificer
Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions that rapidly create magic items. To the untrained, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.

The description of each infusion tells you the type of item that can receive it. The description also tells you if the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can’t learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn the infusion more than once.

Once you create a potion using this infusion, you can’t create another potion until you finish a long rest.

**Reactions**
***Channel Magic.***  The homunculus delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The homunculus must be within 120 feet of you.

That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a different magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Magic Items tables below.
