***The mind and body are strongly linked, and changes in one will affect the other. Manipulating this link allows one to control others, which is why the art is hated and feared by most. However, some believe the power these techniques grant outweigh the moral implications.***

### Blood Clot
When you choose this ritual at 2nd level, you train in manipulating the blood flow inside the brains of others using the power of blood magic, granting you a distinct advantage. By spending 1 blood point as an action, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to any Charisma-based skill checks or saving throws for the next minute.

### Brain Hemorrhage
Starting at 6th level, you drain power from your victims. Whenever you successfully charm one or more creatures using a blood magic spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 spent blood point.

You can still not have more blood points than your maximum amount indicated in the Blood Points column of the Blood Mage table.

### Mind Parasite
At 10th level, you don't let a good puppet go to waste. Whenever a creature you have charmed using a blood mage spell of 1st level or higher is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you immediately regain Hit Points equal to three times the level of the charm spell affecting the creature.

### Blood Hive
Starting at 14th level, your connection to the minds of others becomes more direct. As a reaction whenever you take damage, you take no damage and instead spread the damage evenly (rounding down if needed) among any creatures you currently have charmed using blood mage spells of 1st level or higher. For the purposes of ending the charm effect on a creature, this damage counts as you having attacked the charmed creature.

### Draining Influence
At 18th level, your control over others becomes absolute. As a part of casting a spell using blood magic, you can also expend 5 blood points while you have at least one creature charmed using a blood magic spell. Doing so halves the Hit Point cost of the spell (rounded down) and each creature charmed by you using blood mage spells of 1st level or higher takes damage equal you half the Hit Point cost of the spell (rounded down). For the purposes of ending the charm effect on a creature, this damage counts as you having attacked the charmed creature.

Additonally, you have advantage on saving throws to maintain concentration on charm spells and you gain immunity to the charm effects.
