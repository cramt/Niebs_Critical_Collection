#BloodMage
***You have focused your blood magic on the ways of creation utilizing blood itself. Creating objects, creatures, altering living beings, as well as knitting flesh back together are all parts of this off-putting art.***

### Fleshknitting
When you choose this ritual at 2nd level, you learn how to knit wounds back together utilizing the power of your blood. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to creatures other than yourself, you can cause any of the creatures of your choice to regain additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level by spending 2 Blood Points.

### Blood Imbuement
Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to imbue life into objects using your blood. You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]] once per long rest without expending a spell slot, Hit Points or material components. Instead of summoning a fey or fiend spirit, you instead animate appropriate animal corpses or wooden replicas.

### Rapid Prototyping
At 6th level, you gain the ability to alter your own form using the power of your blood. You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Alter Self\|Alter Self]] on yourself at will, without expending Hit Points, spellslots, or material components.

Additionally, you can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Polymorph\|Polymorph]] on yourself once per long rest without expending Hit Points, a spellslot, or material components.

### Sanguine Potency
Starting at 10th level, your blood becomes more potent when used to heal others. When casting a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to at least one other creature than you, you can spend 5 Blood Points to halve the Hit Point cost of the spell (rounded down).

### Live Dissection
At 14th level, you become a master of manipulating flesh. You can cast either [[dnd5e/Spell/Harm\|Harm]] or [[dnd5e/Spell/Heal\|Heal]] once per long rest without expending a spell slot, Hit Points or material components.

Additionally, whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to remove all of your Corruption.
