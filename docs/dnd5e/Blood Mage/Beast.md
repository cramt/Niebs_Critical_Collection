#BloodMage
***The ritual you performed, changed your body into a more monstrous form. Perhaps you've grown fur on parts of your body, large fangs, claws, or other Hemoscythe Weapons. While you are able to hide most of these new changes, only letting those deserving see them in their final moments.***

### Hemoscythe Weapons
When you choose this ritual at 2nd level, you gain Hemoscythe Weapons. This can come in the form of claws, sharp teeth, a tail, or some other murderous appendage. Work with your DM on how your Hemoscythe weapons look. Regardless of what kind of Hemoscythe Weapons you have, they can be hidden using a bonus action and cannot be detected while hidden in this manner. You can then use another bonus action to reveal your hidden weapons.

While revealed, your Hemoscythe weapons count as finesse melee weapons that you are proficient with, and they deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) on a hit.

The base damage of your Hemoscythe weapons increases to 1d8 when you reach 6th level, to 1d10 at 10th level, to 1d12 at 14th level, and finally to 2d12 at 18th level.

Starting at 6th level, the damage of your Hemoscythe weapons counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances.

### Unarmored Defense
Starting at 2nd level, while you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. If proficient, you can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Blood in the Shadows
Starting from 2nd level, you become supernaturally stealthy and quick. You can hide or dash as a bonus action by expending one Blood Point.

### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Sanguine Cleansing
When you reach 6th level, you learn to cleanse the corruption from your body using the blood of others. When attacking a living creature that has blood using your Hemoscythe Weapons, you can choose to add additional damage dice to the damage roll by expending 3 Blood Points after you roll your attack, but before you know if you hit or not.

The damage dice added are the same size as the damage die of your Hemoscythe weapon at your current level and the number of dice added increases the higher your corruption is.

||~ Corruption Damage |
|Corruption |Extra Damage Dice |
|---|---|
| 10 - 19 | +1 |
| 20 - 29 | +2 |
| 30 - 39 | +3 |
| 40 - 49 | +4 |
| 50+ | +5 |

Whenever you add additional damage dice using this feature, your corruption is reduced by the damage dealt by the attack.

### Beast Shape
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or lower. You can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.

- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

- You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.

- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.

- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Hurried Exangunation
Starting at 14th level, you master combining your blood magic with your unnatural combat abilities. Whenever you use your action to cast a Blood Mage spell or attack on your turn, you can make one weapon attack using your Hemoscythe Weapons as a bonus action.

### Perfect Form
At 18th level, your body has reached its pinnacle. While your Hemoscythe Weapons are revealed, you gain the following passive benefits:
* You gain a flying, swimming, and climbing speed equal to your walking speed
* You have resistance to physical damage from non-silvered weapon attacks
* You can use your bonus action to hide or dash without expending a Blood Point
