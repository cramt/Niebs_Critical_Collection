#BloodMage
***The ritual you performed, enhanced your physical prowess, allowing for effective use of weapons and armor in combination with your blood magic. Additionally, it comes with the power to greater use blood magic for defensive purposes, and to even cheat death.***

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this ritual at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

### Crimson Armaments
After having completed the ritual of the Juggernaut at 2nd level, you learn how to empower your weapons and armor using your innate blood magic. You perform a 1 hour ritual with either a weapon or a suit of armor, at the end of this duration, you magically bond it to your blood. You can magically store the armor or weapon within yourself as a bonus action. You can use another bonus action to have it magically reappear in your hand or on you. The weapon or armor ceases being your crimson armament if you die, or if you perform a 1-hour ritual to break your bond with it. The weapon or armor appears at your feet if it is inside you when the bond breaks.

If a weapon, the weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances and immunities, additionally, whenever you hit with the weapon, you can spend up to 5 blood points. For every blood point spent in this way, your attack deals an additional 1d6 points of the weapons damage type.

If a piece of armor, the armor counts as magical for the purpose of effects that targets nonmagical armors, additionally, whenever you are hit by a melee attack by a creature within 5 feet of you, you can spend up to 5 blood points. For every blood point spent in this way, the attacker takes 1d8 necrotic damage as tendrils of blood assaults the attacker

### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Sanguine Reservoir
When you reach 6th level, you learn to manipulate your blood magic in such a way to not leave you vulnerable afterwards. You gain a special ward called the Sanguine Reservoir. Whenever you lose Hit Points as part of casting a blood magic spell, the Sanguine Reservoir gains the same amount of Hit Points as you lost Hit Points. The combined value of your Hit Points and those of the reservoir can never exceed your maximum Hit Points. If it ever does, the reservoir loses a number of Hit Points until the combined value equals your maximum Hit Points.

Whenever you take damage, the Sanguine Reservoir takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. Temporary Hit Points are expended before the ward is damaged. Like Temporary Hit Points, your Sanguine Reservoir benefits from any damage resistances or immunities you have.

### Armed and Armoured
Starting at 10th level you expand your crimson armament ritual. You can now have both a crimson armaments weapon and a crimson armaments armor, summoning one or both (your choice) as a bonus action.

### Frightless Fright
Also starting at 10th level, you no longer feel the fear of death and instead instil it in others. You gain immunity to the frightened condition.

In addition, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using your Crimson Armaments weapon, each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your blood mage spell DC. On a failure, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A creature immune to charm effects automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

### Born Again
Starting at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 Hit Point instead. You can additionally consume an amount of blood point of your choice, gaining 10 Hit Points per blood point consumed this way. Once you have used this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Body Dive
When you reach 18th level, you can channel the energies within yourself and dive into a creature, before emerging from another creature. Choose a creature with blood that is the same size as you or larger within 30 feet of you. You rapidly speed and jump into the creature. The creature must make a Constitution savi½ng throw against your spell save DC or take 10d10 piercing damage, taking half damage on a successful save. You then choose another creature with blood of the same size as you or larger that you know about on the same plane of existence. You immediately emerge to a spot within 5 feet of the creature, which must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 10d10 piercing damage, taking half damage on a successful saving throw. A creature that fails a save against this effect is also stunned until the end of your next turn.

Additionally, the damage of this ability ignores all resistances.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.
