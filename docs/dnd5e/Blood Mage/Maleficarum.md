### Empowered Well of Blood
When you choose this ritual at 2nd level, you learn how to gain even more power out of the wellspring within you. When you use a blood point, it now reduces the Hit Point cost of a blood magic spell by 5. 

Additionally, you can now spend up to three blood points at a time to reduce the Hit Point cost of a blood magic spell.

### Essence Stealer
When you reach 6th level, you learn to leech the life force from those you slay. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a blood magic spell, you gain 1 blood point.

You can still not have more blood points than your maximum amount indicated in the Blood Points column of the Blood Mage table.

### Blood Siphon
At 10th level, you learn to restore yourself by draining the life of your enemies, or your friends. As an action, you choose a creature with blood within 10 feet of you, and expend 1 to 5 blood points. You can instead use a bonus action if the target is willing. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your blood magic spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 piercing damage per blood point spent. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage. Either way, you regain an amount of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt (rounded up). This effect, cannot reduce a creature below 1 Hit Point.

If used on a willing target, the target can choose to fail the saving throw. If it does so, the damage ignores all resistances and immunities the target has. Additionally, you regain an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt, instead of half.

### Simulacrum of Blood
When you reach 14th level, you gain the ability create a clone of yourself out of your own blood. As an action, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Simulacrum\|simulacrum]] spell with the following changes:
* The simulacrum can only cast spells of 5th level or lower, it does not have access to blood points nor to your blood mutations.
* The simulacrum can not regain Hit Points from any outside source.
* The simulacrum lasts for only 10 minutes.
* You ignore the material components, instead using your own blood.
* You sacrifice an amount of Hit Points of your choice as a part of casting the spell, The Simulacrum has twice this amount as Hit Points.

Once you use this feature you must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.

### Eternal Well
Upon reaching 18th level, you have learned how to more quickly restore the wellspring within your blood. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover half your maximum amount of blood points (rounded down). This cannot exceed your maximum amount of blood points.
