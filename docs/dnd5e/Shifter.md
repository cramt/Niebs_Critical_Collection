#Shifter
***Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features – a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?***

- ***Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.***

- ***Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.***

- ***Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.***

- ***Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.***
