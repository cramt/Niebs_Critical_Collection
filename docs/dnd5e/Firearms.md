### Firearm Properties
Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

***Reload.*** The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

***Misfire.*** Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm.

***Explosive.*** Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

***Loud.*** Whenever you shoot this weapon, it creates a sound audible out to a range, in feet, specified in the property.

***Scatter.*** When you make an attack with a firearm that has the Scatter property, you may choose one other creature within 5ft. of the original target. If the attack roll would hit them, they take one die of the weapon's damage. This property does not function if the weapon misfires.

#### Using a firearm without proficiency
If you attempt to use a firearm without proper proficiency, the usual rules for doing so still apply. Additionally, the firearm's misfire score is doubled, and if you roll a 1 on the d20 when attacking, the firearm is broken and deals its maximum possible damage to you as it violently explodes in your hand.

#### Ammunition
All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.
