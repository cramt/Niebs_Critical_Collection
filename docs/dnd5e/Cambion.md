#Cambion
***Unlike tieflings, who usually possess fiendish traits from an ancient pact their ancestors made, cambions are the direct children of a fiend and a mortal. The fiend can be of any kind, devil or demon, with the mortal humanoid also of any race. These unions are most common between a succubus/incubus and a human.***

***Cambions inherit traits from both of their parents, but almost always have some form of horns, bat-like wings and a leathery tail. Their skin tone is most commonly a vibrant, blood red, with their eyes usually an insidious sulfur-yellow. However, their colouration and fiendish aspects can vary wildly — from black, yellow or blue skin, to hooves instead of feet, to extra digits and eyes. They can possess otherworldly beauty or be entirely grotesque.***

***Regardless of where they were raised, all cambions are born with a sense of overwhelming ambition, and an entitlement to rule over mortals. An entitlement that can very much lead to reality unless stopped, beginning with the forming of small gangs and groups before masterminding large uprisings.***

### Cambion Features

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength, Dexterity and Charisma score each increase by 1.

- **Age.** Cambions mature at the same rate as humans but live up to three hundred years.

- **Alignment.** Cambions are the progeny of fiends, and their souls are ever marked by corruption. Cambions are born evil. Those descended from devils are extremely lawful, those descended from demons are highly chaotic, and those from succubi/incubi can fall anywhere in between.

- **Size.** Cambions stand at roughly the same height as a human when fully grown, although both their fiendish and humanoid parents' sizes may influence this to see them end up slightly shorter, or taller. Your size is medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Flight.** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armour.

- **Darkvision.** Born of fiendish blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

- **Fiendish Presence.** For all intents and purposes, you count as a standard, living creature and not a fiend. However, certain spells and effects that specifically deal in detection instead count you as a fiend. These include [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Evil And Good\|Detect Evil and Good]] and a paladin's Divine Sense. The blood of the lower planes lives in you.

- **Hellish Tricks.** At 3rd level, you begin to unlock the powers of your hellish ancestry. You learn one cantrip you select here. Choose one of the following cantrips: [[dnd5e/Spell/Control Flames\|Control Flames]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Produce Flame\|Produce Flame]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Thaumaturgy\|Thaumaturgy]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Vicious Mockery\|Vicious Mockery]]. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the cantrip.

- **Hellborn Power.** When you reach 5th level you gain further mastery over the wicked powers of your malefic descent. You learn one fiendish spell. Choose one of the following spells you wish to gain at that level: [[dnd5e/Spell/Burning Hands\|Burning Hands]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Charm Person\|Charm Person]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Command\|Command]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Disguise Self\|Disguise Self]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Hellish Rebuke\|Hellish Rebuke]]. You may only cast your selected spell once, regaining the ability to use the spell after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell.

- **Otherworldly Resistance.**  Though you may have been born and bound to the Material Plane you possess a natural resistance to the forces that permeate it. You are resistant to either cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. Once you choose this resistance you cannot choose another.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and either Abyssal or Infernal.
