#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

#### Spell Slots
The Left Hand Spell Table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your left hand spells. To cast one of your left hand spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
You prepare the list of left hand spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Cleric\|cleric spell list]]. When you do so, choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your rogue level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You cannot choose cantrips when preparing spells.

For example, if you are a 7th-level rogue, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of left hand spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Holy Deliverance
Starting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with a sneak attack, you can deal Radiant or Necrotic damage instead of the attack's normal damage. You must choose what type of damage you will do the moment you acquire this ability. You also gain resistance to the damage type you chose.

### Zeal
Starting at 9th level, you are immune to fear and magic can't put you to sleep.

Additionally, you can bring justice to those who deserve it. As a bonus action, you can designate an enemy in your line of sight and for 1 minute or until you use this feature again; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against the target creature if you are within 5 feet of it, as long as you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. Additionally, if you use your action to attack or cast a spell targeting the creature, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action against the same creature.

### Leap of Faith
Starting at 14th level, you can teleport yourself as if using the [[dnd5e/Spell/Dimension Door\|Dimension Door]] spell as an action.

Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Zealous Fire
Starting at 17th level, You become the hand of your god bringing judgement. When attacking the creature targeted by your Zeal feature, your attacks against it have advantage and deal 2d6 Radiant or Necrotic extra damage. The damage type is the same that you chose in your Holy Deliverance feature.

Additionally, you gain immunity to the damage type you chose in your Holy Deliverance feature.
