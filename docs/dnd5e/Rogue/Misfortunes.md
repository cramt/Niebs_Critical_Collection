#### Misfortunes
The misfortunes are presented in alphabetical order.

***Curse of the Befuddled.*** As an action you can spend 2 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye is charmed for 10 minutes. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and the charmed condition ends early if you or your allies deal damage to the creature or cause it to make a saving throw. After the 10 minutes have elapsed, the creature knows you used magic to influence its mood and disposition towards you.

***Curse of the Clumsy.*** When a creature marked by your evil eye moves 5 feet or more, you can use your reaction and spend 3 jinx points to cause the creature to fall prone and have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of the turn. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye.

***Curse of the Debilitated.*** When a creature marked by your evil eye takes damage, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to roll 1d12. The creature takes necrotic damage and reduces its maximum hit points equal to the result.

***Curse of the Doomed.*** After you miss with a weapon attack against a creature marked by your evil eye, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to make an additional weapon attack against the creature as part of the same action.

***Curse of the Fearful.*** As an action you can spend 2 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye is frightened for 1 minute. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and it can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this misfortune early on a success.

***Curse of the Inept.*** After a creature marked by your evil eye makes an ability check or attack roll, but before the DM declares whether or not it is successful, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to make the creature reroll and use the lower result.

***Curse of the Insensate.*** As an action you can spend 3 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye is blinded and deafened for 1 minute. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and it can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this misfortune early on a success.

***Curse of the Maimed.*** When you hit a creature marked by your evil eye with a weapon attack, and the die result was 18 or 19, you can use your reaction and spend 2 jinx points to turn the hit into a critical.

***Curse of the Marked.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 2 jinx points to enhance the effects of your evil eye on a creature you have marked by it. When you do, the duration increases to 24 hours or until you mark a different creature with your evil eye, whichever comes first. Additionally, while the creature is marked by your evil eye, you always know the direction and distance to the creature, provided you are on the same plane.

***Curse of the Plagued.*** When a creature marked by your evil eye regains hit points, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to halve the amount of hit points regained. When you do, the creature can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

***Curse of the Ruined.*** After a creature marked by your evil eye makes a saving throw, but before the DM declares whether or not it is successful, you can use your reaction and spend 2 jinx points to make the creature reroll and use the lower result.

***Curse of the Somnolent.*** As an action, you can spend 3 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye becomes drowsy. Roll a number of d10 equal to your level in this class and add 15 to their total. If the creature’s current hit points are equal to or less than the total, it goes unconscious. The target regains consciousness after 10 minutes, or when it takes damage or another creature uses its action to rouse it.

***Curse of the Unlucky.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 2 jinx points to put a pox on a creature marked by your evil eye. Whenever the creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, you roll 1d4 and subtract the result from their total. This pox ends when the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye.
