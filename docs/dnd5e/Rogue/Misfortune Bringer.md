#Rogue
***You’ve matched your penchant for illicit activities with the ability to mark your enemies for mishaps and misfortune. Whether your mother was a hag, you were imbued with magical powers by spending time among the fey, or you learned the art of cursing from a long line of hedge wizards before you, you are a Misfortune Bringer. Although not universal, many Misfortune Bringers have eyes of two different colors, using only one when glaring at the targets they intend to curse.***

### Evil Eye
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to place a minor curse on others with a glance. As a bonus action on your turn, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. The chosen creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your misfortune save DC or be marked by your evil eye. While a creature is marked by your evil eye, you can use your Sneak Attack against the creature even if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.

The creature remains marked by your evil eye for 1 minute or until you mark a different creature with your evil eye, whichever comes first.

### Misfortunist
Also at 3rd level, you learn misfortunes that you can inflict on those marked by your evil eye.

***Misfortunes.*** You learn two misfortunes of your choice, which are detailed on the [[dnd5e/Rogue/Misfortunes\|Misfortunes]] page.

You learn an additional misfortune of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Each time you finish a long rest, you can replace one misfortune you know with a different one.

***Jinx Points.*** You have three jinx points. When you spend a jinx point, it is no longer available to you until you regain it. You regain all spent jinx points when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain two additional jinx points at 13th level.

***Saving Throws.*** Your evil eye, and some of your misfortunes, require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Misfortune save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Steal Luck
Starting at 9th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to remove advantage from the roll. When you do, you regain an expended jinx point. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

At 17th level, you can use this feature three times, regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Curse Caster
At 13th level, you can use an action and spend 3 jinx points to cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Bestow Curse\|Bestow Curse]] spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
