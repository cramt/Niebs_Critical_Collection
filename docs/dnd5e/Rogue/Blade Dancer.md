#Rogue
***Blade Dancers connect with their blades and hone the ability to either curve a single dagger through the battlefield to hit one or multiple targets, or bond with blade after blade until they have an army of weaponry at their disposal to throw around. Notable masters in this profession have even been known to arrange their knives along a cloak or in place of one, creating a deadly looking curtain of blades that protects them at all times.***

### Bonded Blade
You can spend one hour sharpening a dagger, dart, or handaxe while mentally focusing on it to bond with it. Once bonded, you are able to control the weapon with your thoughts and cause it to telekinetically move around, though the blade itself is still considered a standard weapon and does not become magical.

As long as you are within range of a bonded weapon (50 feet x your rogue level) you can use a bonus action to command your weapon to come to you. The weapon can travel 60 feet per round and your connection with it is so strong that it will weave around obstacles until it arrives in your hand, if it can find a path.

You can bond with a number of weapons equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You can command a number of bonded blades at once with a bonus action equal to your proficiency bonus.

As a bonus action, you can either throw a number of blades equal to your proficiency bonus to unoccupied squares within 60 feet of you that you can see, or recall a number of bonded blades equal to your proficiency bonus to you (this can include any bonded weapon you threw at a creature as part of an attack action.)

When you recall a weapon, each creature in the weapon's space and along a 5-foot line between the blade and your character must make a saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice) slashing damage.

Starting at 6th level, each blade you are bonded with is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Blade Performance
At 3rd level, you also gain Performance Points to help fuel your weapons. You gain a number of Performance Points equal to 2 times your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended Performance Points upon finishing a short or long rest. You can also spend a bonus action to regain one expended point, but you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

You have the following uses for your performance points:
***Honed Edge.*** As an action by expending one Performance Point, you can infuse all your bonded weapons at once, making them strike true. The next time you make an attack with each of these weapons within the next 10 minutes, roll a die equal to the damage die of the weapon and add it to the attack roll. The weapon then loses this property until you spend another point on this ability. Then the weapon returns to you.
***Bladed Defense.*** As part of your bonus action to throw out your bonded weapons, you can spend a Performance Point to infuse them to aid in deflecting damage. When a creature within 5 feet of a weapon is hit with a melee or ranged attack, you can choose to have the weapon flash into motion and deflect part of the blow, reducing the damage by the weapons damage dice. Then the weapon returns to you.

Starting at 17th level, the number of weapons you can bond with becomes equal to your proficiency bonus times your rogue level instead.

### Blade Mystic
At 3rd level, you learn to cast spells using your Performance Points. You use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting modifier for these spells (your choice.)

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen modifier

You learn two of the cantrips below of your choice. At 10th level, you may select a third cantrip option.
* [[dnd5e/Spell/Blade Ward\|Blade Ward]]
* [[dnd5e/Spell/Booming Blade\|Booming Blade]]
* [[dnd5e/Spell/Green Flame Blade\|Green Flame Blade]]
* [[dnd5e/Spell/Sword Burst\|Sword Burst]]

You gain access to cast the spells below at certain levels. Regardless of the spell's description (such as limits on the Cordon of Arrows spell or the description in Melf's Minute Meteors) you use your bonded weapons for these spells. To cast these spells, you must spend Performance Points equal to the level of the spell. If you cannot spend enough points for the spell, you cannot cast it. In addition, once you have cast a spell of 1st level or higher with Performance Points, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spells or a long rest for spells of 4th level and above.

### On the Knife's Edge
At 9th level, you can use your bonus action to teleport to the location of one or your bonded weapons within 40 feet of you. If the weapon's space is occupied, you teleport to within 5 feet of that space instead. When you teleport, you can choose one of the options below:

* You swap places with your weapon, leaving it behind to strike a foe. You may make an immediate melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of the space you previously occupied. You have advantage on this attack. Once this attack has been made, the weapon magically returns to you.

* You teleport directly to a bonded blade and strike an enemy within range. Make a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of your new location. You have advantage on this attack.

### Dancer's Grace
At 13th level, you gain additional options for using your Performance Points.

***Dancer's Rebuke.*** When you are hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction and spend up to 3 Performance Points to strike back at your foe. For each point spent, the target must succeed on a dexterity saving throw vs your spell save DC or take 2d6 slashing damage from your bonded weapons.
***Dancer's Defense.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you may spend 2 Performance Point to cause your weapons to whirl around you rapidly, potentially blocking strikes. Any melee or ranged weapon attack against you has disadvantage until your next turn and if a target within 5 feet of your misses with an attack against you, it takes 1d6 slashing damage from your bonded weapons.
***Dancer's Guile.*** When you roll a deception, performance, intimidation, or persuasion check, you may immediately spend 1 performance point to gain advantage on the roll.
***Thundering Steel.*** As an action, you may spend 2 performance points to rattle enemies around you. Choose a bonded weapon within range. You launch another one of your weapons at it and create a sonorous tone that is heard by creatures up to 150 feet away. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of the struck weapon must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they take 2d6 Thunder damage and are knocked prone, or half as much on a successful save and are not knocked prone. Regardless of if they make their save, each creature affected in the area is deafened until the end of your next turn.

### Perfected Bond
At 17th level, your ability to bond with your weapons of choice becomes absolute. You only need to spend 10 minutes bonding with a weapon, instead of 1 hour, and you may choose one of your weapons to become your Prime Weapon.

You gain additional features with this Prime Weapon outside of your normal weapons.

A Prime Weapon is considered to be a +2 magical weapon, if not already. The weapon deals 1d8 damage instead of its normal damage and ignores all resistances and immunities to damage.

You may control a Prime Weapon from any distance, rather than the usual limitations, so long as you are on the same plane of existence.

When you cast a spell using Performance Points, you may use your Prime Weapon's space as the origin for that spell, provided it is within 100 feet of you.

***Swarm of Steel.*** As a bonus action, you may command your Prime Weapon to become a deadly vortex of metal. When you use this feature and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you may command the weapon to move up to 20 feet in a straight line of your choice. Any space occupied by one of your bonded blades that your Prime Weapon passes over becomes a part of this swarm (up to a maximum of six additional bonded weapons.) The first creature that occupies a square the swarm moves through must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they take 1d8+2 slashing damage, plus an additional 1d4 slashing damage per bonded blade in the swarm, or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that starts it turn in the Swarm of Steel's space or moves enters it on their turn must make this saving throw as well. A creature can only take this damage once per turn.
The swarm lasts for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it.
Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Unconscious Command.*** Your Prime Weapon can keep fighting even if you cannot. If you are incapacitated at the start of your turn, your weapon may immediately move 20 feet in a straight line as if it were under the effect of the Swarm of Steel, even if it has already been used. Each blade picked up by the prime weapon during this move drops to the ground at the end of this movement, unable to be used until you are able to take actions again.
