#Warlock
***You have made a pact with a powerful vampire cursed by the gods or born as a creature of the night. Hundreds of haunted beings serve this vampire, so why enter a pact with you? Because you can act in the light of day unhindered? To cull weaker vampires?***

### Nocturnal Predator
At 1st level, as a predator of the night you have been blessed with enhanced vision in darkness. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, increase the range by 60 feet.

### Drain Life
Starting at 1st level, you gain an innate power to drain life from the living. When you use the Attack action or cast a spell, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. Your attack deals necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma ability modifier on a hit.

When you hit a creature with this feature, you can expend a warlock spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot. When you expend a spell slot to enhance the attack in this way, you regain hit points equal to the total damage dealt.

### Creature of the Night
At 6th level, you can use your action to cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Polymorph\|Polymorph]] on yourself, transforming into a bat or wolf. While you are in either of these forms, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining all spent uses upon completion of a long rest.

### Eldritch Appetite
Starting at 10th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with your Life Drain feature, you can use your reaction to consume the last of their fleeting mortality.

When you do, you regain one of your expended pact spell slots. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Eternal Night
At 14th level, your vampire patron grants you a taste of true immortality. You no longer age, and you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

Additionally, once per long rest, you can use a bonus action to gain the following effects for one minute:

You regain 1d6 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point and aren’t in direct sunlight or running water. If you take radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of your next turn.

When using your Drain Life feature, you can use it as if you were expending a 1st-level spell slot without expending a spell slot.
