#Warlock
***Your patron is a great construct, perhaps a grand creation long forgotten, or perhaps something from the plane of Mechanus, a realm of absolute law and order. A powerful Modron may have entered into a pact with you in order further the strict duties and responsibilities of its kind. Primus himself may have even bestowed a portion of his power on you. Re-imagined in their images, you are transformed into a cog of their great cosmic machine.***

### Marks of Machine
Your ties to your construct patron may have granted you one or more observable traits. Bellow are a few examples of such traits.

These traits are optional, but serve to further deepen your character’s connection to their patron. You can choose to not have any of these traits, some of them, or perhaps even gain some as you level. It is up to your discretion.

||~ Marks of Machine Quirks |
|d6 |Quirk |
|---|---|
| 1 | You exhibit a moderate to severe case of obsessive compulsive disorder. |
| 2 | Your movements are jerky and mechanical. |
| 3 | You emit a mechanical whirring sound every time you breathe. |
| 4 | You emit a small painless shock every time you touch a creature. |
| 5 | You are compelled to learn and categorize the laws of a new town, village, or reign every time you enter one. |
| 6 | You hear a constant ticking sound inside your head. |

### Expanded Spell List
The Construct lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

||~ Construct Expanded Spells | 
|Spell Level |Spell |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Shield\|Shield]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Identify\|Identify]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Calm Emotions\|Calm Emotions]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Enhance Ability\|Enhance Ability]] |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Haste\|Haste]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Tiny Servant\|Tiny Servant]] |
| 4th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Fabricate\|Fabricate]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Leomunds Secret Chest\|Leomund's Secret Chest]] |
| 5th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Modify Memory\|Modify Memory]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Telepathic Bond\|Telepathic Bond]] |

### Mind of Logic
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability when using this subclass. You use it to determine your spell attack bonus and your spell save DC.

If any Eldritch Invocations make use of your Charisma modifier, you can choose to utilize your Intelligence modifier instead.

### Repair Protocols
At 1st level, you learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Mending\|Mending]] cantrip. It count as a warlock cantrip for you, but doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

### Reliable Programming
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with one Intelligence-based skill of your choice. Any roll on the d20 that utilizes that skill will automatically be counted as a roll of 10, no matter what was rolled.

### Evasive Firewalls
At 6th level, your mind is restructured completely by the influence of your patron.

You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Wisdom or Intelligence saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Logical Progression
At 6th level, your body begins transforming and shifting. You are slowly becoming… Something else.

You become a Construct in addition to any other creature types you are. Spells and abilities that affect Constructs of a specific CR have no effect on you.

You have advantage on saving throws against any spells or abilities that attempt to alter your form or petrify you, such as the [[dnd5e/Spell/Polymorph\|Polymorph]] spell.

Additionally, the magical logic from your patron protects you from corruption. You have advantage on any saving throw against charm, fear, and any spell that would change your alignment.

### Probability Disturbance
At 10th level, as a reaction, if a creature you can see within 60 feet attacks, makes a saving throw, or makes an ability check, you can turn whatever was rolled on the d20 into a 10, no matter what was rolled. You can do this after the roll, but before the DM determines the outcome.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.

### Evolution Protocols
Starting from 14th level, your skin starts to harden and your bones realign. After many excruciatingly painful days, your transformation is finally complete. Gears may have sprouted through your skin, limbs might have been replaced with metal replicas, whatever the case, you are now part magical construct, part organic being. You have reached the point of no return.

Be careful from here on out. Many would seek to capture you. Either to destroy you like the abomination you have become, or to tear you apart, piece by piece and study what remains.

- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

- You are immune to disease.

- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

- You are immune to spells and abilities that attempt to alter your form, except spells cast by you.

- You cannot be petrified.

- You no longer age at a normal rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

- You gain 1 max health for each level of Warlock you have, and gain additional 1 max health for all subsequent Warlock levels
