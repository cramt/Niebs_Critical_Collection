#Warlock
***Unlike most otherworldly patrons, yours is, or at least, once was a mortal being, perhaps from another dimension, perhaps even from your world. At some point in their lives, they unlocked the true potential of Arcane magic and are able to imbue you with a portion of this power. Perhaps you always dreamed of becoming a wizard, but couldn't master the spells, and sought out a powerful mage to make a deal with. Perhaps you found a long-dead wizard who trapped their soul in a phylactery and needs to act through you.***

***However you came to meet your patron, you have a tenuous pact, where they imbue you with their magic in exchange for you doing their dirty work for them.***

### Expanded Spell List
The Archmage lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

|Spell Level |Spells |

### Spellcasting Ability
At 1st level, you can choose to have Intelligence be your spellcasting ability instead of Charisma. If you choose to do so, you may also use your Intelligence modifier whenever your Charisma modifier would be used in another warlock feature or Eldtritch Invocation.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Teachings of the Mage
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you a grimoire filled with some early magical secrets.

When you gain this feature, choose one cantrip and one 1st level spell from [[dnd5e/Spells\|any class's spell list]]. While the book is on your person, you can cast the cantrip at will. It is considered a warlock spell for you, and it doesnâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known. The 1st level spell is added to your grimoire.

Any warlock spells you know or learn are automatically added to your grimoire.

Once a spell is written in your grimoire, you may, during any long rest, replace one of your known spells with one of the ones in your book. These spells cannot exceed a spell level that you have access to. In addition, if you encounter any books containing spells, scrolls, etc., you can copy the spell into your book at the cost of 50g per spell level. This process takes 2 hours per spell level.

If you lose your grimoire, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest. Any spells that were written in your previous grimoire are lost forever.

If you later gain the Pact of the Tome feature, you can choose to combine your grimoire with your Book of Shadows.

### Rituals of the Master
Starting from 6th level, your understanding of the arcane arts increases.

Choose two 1st level spells from [[dnd5e/Spells\|any spell list]] that have the ritual tag and add them to your grimoire.

You can cast any spell written in your Grimoire or a spell you know with the ritual tag as a ritual.

Additionally, you can cast a single spell that you know or have written in your grimoire that has the ritual tag without expending a spell slot. Once you do this, you must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.

### Arcane Absorption
Beginning at 10th level, you learn to draw the magical energies from spells cast at you.

If you are subjected to a spell that requires you to make a saving throw to take half damage, you can use your reaction to automatically fail the saving throw and immediately regain one expended Warlock spell slot.

Once you use this feature you must complete a short or long rest before being able to do so again.

### Arcane Imprint
When you reach 14th level, you have gained such mastery over a specific spell, that the arcane forces required to cast it lie permanently in your blood. The sigils, texts, and glyphs required to unleash it are permanently etched into your hands.

Choose a 1st level Warlock spell that you know. You can cast this spell at its lowest level at will, without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast this spell at a higher level, you must expend a slot of a relevant level.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange this spell for another 1st level Warlock spell that you know.
