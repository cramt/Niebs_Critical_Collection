#Warlock
***Your patron is known for being somewhat of a tinkerer, and a pioneer in the world of engineering when they show their face. While that is infrequent, it is highly impactful, and their warlocks are one example of this. You are their first source of feedback for all of their new devices. In other words, you're the test dummy. Beings of this sort are varied, not specifically limited by anything, but likely quite involved.***

### Expanded Spell List
The Black Powder Baron lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Firearm Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with firearms and Tinker's Tools.

### Experimental Weaponry
Starting at 1st level, your patron has agreed to "upgrade" your armaments. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a firearm that lacks the two-handed property and cause it to disappear. You can have a number of weapons "upgraded" this way equal to your half your Charisma modifier, rounded up.

When you take the attack action, or as a bonus action, you can summon the firearm into your hand. A summoned firearm's damage is force damage, instead of the weapon's normal damage type. Additionally, when summoned this way, you can use your firearm as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells and you can cast the somatic component of spells with a firearm in each hand.

At the end of each of your turns, you can choose to dismiss the weapon (no action required). A summoned firearm is automatically dismissed after one minute.

### Curious Translocation
At 6th level, you may pass through one of your patron's experimental planes to get away.

As an action, you can teleport up to 15 feet away to a point you can see and roll 1d4 on the table below.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

|d4 |benefit |
|---|---|
| 1 | You turn invisible until the start of your next turn |
| 2 | All misfired, but not broken, firearms on your person are fixed. |
| 3 | You can immediately make one firearm attack against a creature within range as part of the same action. |
| 4 | Gain 1d6 + half of your Warlock level temporary hit points that last until you take a short rest. |

### Sudden Hemorrhage
By 10th level, your weapons are starting to cause secondary effects at unexpected times.

When a creature that you have hit with a firearm attack since your last turn targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll as their wound opens unexpectedly.

### Infused Arcana
Upon reaching 14th level, you can infuse a bullet with a spell.

When you use your action to cast a spell with a warlock spell slot, you can delay the effects of the spell. This spell must be of 1st level or higher, have a casting time of one action and not have a range of self.

As a part of the same action, make a firearm attack.

If the attack hits, the target takes the normal damage of the attack and the spell is cast on them, either as the sole target or as the center of the effect, regardless of the spell's range. You have advantage on any spell attack rolls made as part of casting the spell and the target has disadvantage on saves made against it. If the spell requires you to make a weapon attack as part of casting it, this attack counts as performing the attack.

If the attack misses, the spell is wasted.
