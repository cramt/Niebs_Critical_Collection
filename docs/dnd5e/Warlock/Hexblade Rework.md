#Warlock
***You have made a pact with a mysterious entity taking the form of a weapon. You wield this weapon and channel great power through it. Power, you were not meant to have - power, you can hardly contain.***

*This is a set of optional class features for the Hexblade Warlock subclass. They replace the default class features. When you acquire this subclass, you can choose to go with the default class features or the ones listed below. You cannot choose class features from one version and replace ones in another - you must fully commit to the default Hexblade or this homebrew version.*

### Expanded Spell List
The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Hex Warrior
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armour, shields, and martial weapons.

### Hex Weapon
Your patron is your weapon, quite literally. You have bound yourself with a specific weapon, and use it to channel your newfound powers.

When you choose this subclass, you get to design the weapon, along with your DM. The weapon can be any melee weapon you are proficient with.

No matter the weapon’s type, its minimum damage die is a d8. Thus, if the weapon has a smaller damage die, the die is changed to a d8. This also includes weapons that have more than one damage die, as long as both dice are smaller than a d8. The weapon is also considered magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity.

The weapon requires attunement and can only be attuned by you. While attuned to the weapon, it takes up no attunement slots, and it functions as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells.

When you attack with the weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

The weapon can communicate with you telepathically up to 300 feet away but perceives only through your senses as you are its host. Work with your DM to determine what its personality is and its relationship to your character.

This weapon's magical properties grant you your class features. If the weapon is somehow killed or destroyed completely, you lose your class features in this class. If you somehow get the weapon back, your class features are restored.

### Hexblade's Curse
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one small or larger creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you curse a new target, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.

- Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

- If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

You can’t use this feature again until you use your Hexblade weapon kill another medium or larger creature, that isn’t an undead or a construct, or you finish a short or long rest.

### Master of Hexes
Starting at 6th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature.
 
When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you as a free action, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.

### Hungering Blade
Starting at 6th level, you can over the course of 1 hour have your Hexblade Weapon consume another magical weapon. When a weapon is consumed this way, it is lost forever and can only be restored using a Wish.

Your Hexblade Weapon gains some of the magical weapon’s bonuses, be it a +1 attack bonus or innate spells. These bonuses don’t necessarily stack, and it is up to your DM to decide what happens.

Some weapons, including Legendary and Artifact weapons, are immune to this feature.

### Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your Hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

### Draining Hex
Starting at 14th level, if you reduce a creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse to 0 hit points using your Hexblade weapon, roll a d4. On an 4, you regain one expended Warlock spell slot, and the curse ends. If you roll a 3 or lower the curse functions as normal.
