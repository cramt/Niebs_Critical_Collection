#YuanTi
***The serpent creatures known as yuan-ti are all that remains of an ancient, decadent human empire. Ages ago their dark gods taught them profane, cannibalistic rituals to mix their flesh with that of snakes, producing a caste-based society of hybrids in which the most snakelike are the leaders and the most humanlike are spies and agents in foreign lands.***

- **Age.** Yuan-ti hatch from eggs and reach adulthood by age 12. Most yuan-ti live about 80 years, but some live up to 120 years.

- **Size.** Purebloods match humans in average size and weight. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Innate Spellcasting.** You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Animal Friendship\|animal friendship]] an unlimited number of times with this trait, but you can target only snakes with it. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Yuan-ti Malison
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Shapechanger.** You can use your action to polymorph into a medium snake, or back into your true form. Your statistics are the same in each form, except your snake formâ€™s AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
While transformed, your fanged mouth is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it you deal 1d4 piercing damage and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage. The damage increases to 3d4 at 6th level, 4d4 at 11th level, and 5d4 at 16th level.
The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. You cannot speak or cast spells while transformed.

- **Serpentine Feature.** You are a humanoid snake hybrid, and it is immediately clear to anyone who sees you. Each feature grants you a different bonus. Your snake-like feature is one of the following types:

**Type 1:** Human body with snake head. You do not have to be transformed to use your natural weapon, but if you are not transformed the poison deals half damage.

**Type 2:** Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet. You may use your tail to grapple a creature without requiring a free hand.

**Type 3:** Human head and body with snakes for arms. You do not have to be transformed to make unarmed strikes with your natural weapons, but if you are not transformed the unarmed strikes do not apply poison. If you are grappling a
creature you may use your bonus action to make an attack using your natural weapon against that creature. Your snake arms impose disadvantage on your sleight of hand checks.

- **Adaptive Resistance.** When you are targeted by a spell or caught within the area of effect of a spell, as a reaction you may toughen yourself to magical energy. You have advantage on the next saving throw you make against a spell or other magical effect. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
