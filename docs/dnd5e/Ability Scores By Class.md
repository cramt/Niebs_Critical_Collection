#AbilityScoresByClass
[[dnd5e/[toc\|]]]

*This house rule is heavily inspired by the work of [[dnd5e/Gabejamesgames.itch.io\|Gabe James]]*

# Preface
### What is Ability Scores by Class?
As the name suggests, when using this optional rule, your ability score increases are defined by your class, instead of your race.

The option is made available to make more builds possible. While you might see using this option as a bit Meta-gamey, which it kinda is, but that's okay. The option is there, so there's less of a chance of you falling behind with your builds.

### Why should I use it?
For instance, using this rule, a Kobold Barbarian is a more viable option. But then again, playing a Barbarian who is a weakling could be a fun and interesting character idea to explore.

If you want to change your given ability score increases, just ask your dm.

Again this is optional, and you should not feel forced to do it.

# The Rules
### Replacing Racial Score Increases
When using this, the ability score increase from the character's race and subrace is ignored. Racial abilities, such as the Elves' Fey Ancestry or Trance are unaffected and still tied to the racial choice.

### Step-by-Step
Each class has three different steps. This is intended to be used during character creation. In each of the steps, it asks a question and gives you a choice between two different values. You may only select one choice for each step you are offered.

To be explicitly clear you will choose a first step, a second step, and a third step. These are what give you your statistic changes (+1 to Strength, +1 to Wisdom, etc.) This bonus is only applied for the first time the class is taken and can only be applied once.

### Multiclassing
You only gain the increase to your ability scores using this rule when you first create your character and choose your level 1 class. Any future classes you multiclass into do not get their own ability score increases.

However, if you have a plan for multiclassing when creating your character, run it by your dm. Changes can be made to your given ability score increases, to better reflect the future that is to come for your character.

# The Classes
### The Artificer
#### What Makes them an Artificer?
Is your character known for their skills with tools? Their vast understanding of blueprints and machinery? Are they the first on the scene to help out and try to rebuild? Do they build machines to solve their problems, or do they jump headfirst into the fray themselves?
 
#### First Step
What is your greatest strength? Being quick on your feet or quick with your mind?

||~ First Step: Artificer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Quick-footed | +1 Dexterity |
| Quick-minded | +1 Intelligence |

#### Second Step
You've just created a new alchemical concoction and you have yet to figure out what it does. Do you drink it and see what happens, or do you try to figure it out theoretically first?

||~ Second Step: Artificer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Analyzer | +1 Intelligence |
| Strong Gut | +1 Constitution |

#### Third Step
Would you rather finish a job quickly and risk making mistakes, or would you rather endure the extra time double-checking everything would take?

||~ Third Step: Artificer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Rapid Builder | +1 Dexterity |
| Marathon Crafter | +1 Constitution |

#### Consider Your Craft
The most important thing about Artificers is their love of creation. What does your character love to create? How does it look? Do they create small clockwork animals? Are they a mad scientist, a chef, or a combat medic? What do they make and how do they use it?

### The Barbarian
#### What Makes them a Barbarian?
What type of Barbarian is this character? Is their rage one that explodes outwards and destroys everything in their path? Is this a silent rage that is an inward storm until they make their first swing with no regret? Let’s think it through! What do they fear, what have they faced?

#### First Step
Do you pride yourself more on being a stalwart titan that can endure injury with a fountain of health or more as a vicious combatant who can deal mighty blows?

||~ First Step: Barbarian |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Stalwart Titan | +1 Constitution |
| Vicious Combatant | +1 Strength |

#### Second Step
Do you have the ability you would boast when it comes to throwing at a distant target or are you primarily going to focus on charging at them to deal the most damage possible while you look them in the eyes?

||~ Second Step: Barbarian |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Ranged Hunter | +1 Dexterity |
| Charge Ahead | +1 Strength |

#### Third Step
When danger is ahead of you, is your focus on avoiding as much damage as possible or is your focus on enduring it as long as you can?

||~ Third Step: Barbarian |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Avoidance | +1 Dexterity |
| Endurance | +1 Constitution |

#### Consider the visual of your rage
Anger, as we know, manifests in so many different ways and that is a major part of the Barbarian class. Some of them give different visuals but I ask you what is the rage like for you.

Is the default emotion sadness? Does it vary depending on who they fight? Barbarian's don't have to be mindless fighting machines although they can be! Is the rage something they use sparingly and reserve for those they hate or does it trigger out of excitement and anticipation?

### The Bard
#### What Makes them a Bard?
What type of Bard is this character? Are they a fan of poem and sonnets? Are they the one who recounts unbelievable tales or do they consider themselves more the one who remembers things to minute details so that history can never be forgotten? There is magic in their words, but is it magic through essence or just magical through imagination?

Whether they are a dancer, singer, or performer they are a bard.

#### First Step
Do you see yourself as the storyteller of unique tales, a weaver of words, that would seem almost impossible to believe (whether true or not) or are you more the bard who recounts things in explicit detail so that stories of truth are never forgotten?

||~ First Step: Bard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Storyweaver | +1 Charisma |
| Living Recounter | +1 Intelligence |

#### Second Step
Sometimes your words or actions can get you into worrisome situations but there is always a way out! The question is, are you the one who talks their way out of trouble or sneaks out before it even gets that far?

||~ Second Step: Bard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Smooth Talker | +1 Charisma |
| Sly | +1 Dexterity |

#### Third Step
On the rare chance you cannot leave a situation what would you pride yourself on most? Your ability to think through the next move ideally or your ability to react regardless of what follows. The show must go on, how will you prepare?

||~ Third Step: Bard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Intuition | +1 Intelligence |
| Reaction Time | +1 Dexterity |

#### Consider The Way You Perform
You are a bard and the world is your stage but how do you show it? Is it through spoken word, is it through song, is it dancing and performance? Interpretive dance is a wonderful way to cast a somatic spell. Does your bard try to evoke specific emotions? Is it a comedy? Fear? Excitement? It can be a variety! The world is ready for your tale to be written! What is your tool?

### The Blood Hunter (MM)
#### What Makes them a Blood Hunter?
Were you born into your order, or where you picked up as a stray? Do you have a reason to hunt monsters, or is it simply your way of living? Do you secretly enjoy the darker, forbidden, side of yourself?

#### First Step
Are they focused more on fighting with agility and attack from a distance, or do they solve their problems with a more personal touch?

||~ First Step: Blood Hunter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Agile | +1 Dexterity |
| Brute | +1 Strength |

#### Second Step
Do they solve their problems peacefully or do they prefer to crush them into nothingness?

||~ Second Step: Blood Hunter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Thinker | +1 Intelligence |
| Crusher | +1 Strength |

#### Third Step
You are in a dark forest that is known for its mushrooms. And you are hungry. Do you try random ones and try to dodge the toxic clouds some of them emit or have you already committed which ones are poisonous to memory?

||~ Third Step: Blood Hunter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Planning | +1 Intelligence |
| Reaction | +1 Dexterity |

#### Consider How You Came to be
Does your character enjoy being a blood hunter? Was it even their choice? Do they feel conflicted about the darker side of the craft? Are they at risk of giving in?

### The Blood Mage (Guild)
#### What Makes them a Blood Mage?
Have you studied the art of Blood Magic, or have you undergone some dark pact with a mysterious being? Are your abilities innate, taught, or given to you?

#### First Step
Are they focused more on brute forcing their way with blood, or do they take a more calculated approach?

||~ First Step: Blood Mage |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Agile | +1 Constitution |
| Brute | +1 Intelligence |

#### Second Step
Do they plan ahead more, or do they rely on their speed to get things done?

||~ Second Step: Mage |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Thinker | +1 Dexterity |
| Crusher | +1 Intelligence |

#### Third Step
You are badly hurt, and you don't have enough blood to cast spells. You you power through or run away?

||~ Third Step: Blood Mage |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Planning | +1 Consitution |
| Reaction | +1 Dexterity |

#### Consider Your Bloodied History
Does your character enjoy the sight of blood? Do they revel in their powers, or are they disgusted by themselves? What does using their own blood to cast spells mean to them?

### The Cleric
#### What Makes them a Cleric?
What type of Cleric is this character? Does their belief come from higher powers or are they someone who is found the ability to harness the power of the divine but without knowing directly who they are? What made them a follower of this path? Are they a healer who uses their abilities freely or sparingly? Do they stand beside their allies or protect them from a distance?

#### First Step
Whether their clerical training was through clergy or self-practice, did they put an emphasis more on their fighting ability or connection to the divinity linked magic they could grasp? When in combat, do they raise their weapon first or their holy symbol?

||~ First Step: Cleric |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Battle Cleric | +1 Strength |
| Divine Magic | +1 Wisdom |

#### Second Step
They have come across a wayward soul who needs to be motivated. There is a challenge ahead of them but how will they face the challenge? Will they show them their might to give them comfort or inspire them with their words and their voice guide them?

||~ Second Step: Cleric |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Clerical Might | +1 Strength |
| Clergy Charm | +1 Charisma |

#### Third Step
Helping one soul can be a feat, but the true challenge comes when they've got to motivate many. A horde of creatures stands in front of them and their allies stand beside them. None have taken a step forward but they have this moment. They stand atop a rock but do they command attention with their holy symbol to channel divinity through they or raise their voice and hand to reassure them why they fight?

||~ Third Step: Cleric |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Divine Beacon | +1 Wisdom |
| Brave Voice | +1 Charisma |

#### Consider Your Origins
Are you from a clergy? Was there a major event where their magic power appeared and if so, was it expected and something they prepared for or was it more unexpected power? How many are with you in this clerical group if you even come from a group?

### The Druid
#### What Makes them a Druid?
What type of Druid is this character? Nature is their ally but what aspects of nature do they feel flow into this character. Do they harness the primal forces, do they embrace a strong connection to the animals around them, do they treat flora as an extension of themself? How does their druidic magic manifest?

#### First Step
You are a druid. You are the bridge between natural life. as you become connected more with yourself in the world around you what would you say stuck out? Would you say you understood movements of creatures and plant life or was it you could you feel the flow of nature's energy around you?

||~ First Step: Druid |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Nature's Movements | +1 Dexterity |
| Wild Energy | +1 Wisdom |

#### Second Step
Having a connection to the natural means that sometimes bits of it leave remnants. You are dreaming and there is a great beast before you. It asks you do you want more the agility of the wild or its knowledge?

||~ Second Step: Druid |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Agility | +1 Dexterity |
| Knowledge | +1 Intelligence |

#### Third Step
Two enormous parts of the natural world are the plants and animals that live in it. Does this druid have a stronger connection to one or the other, or was it that instead, they started with a connection towards one first, and then it may have led to the other? If they leaned toward one which would it be?

||~ Third Step: Druid |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Flora (Plant-life) | +1 Intelligence |
| Fauna (Animal-life) | +1 Wisdom |

#### Consider Where Your Magic Comes From
Much of magic comes from deities but yours can come from something entirely different. Is there a connection to a primal volcano, the ocean itself, or even the sun or moon? Consider creative ways that your druid connects to their magic.

### The Fighter
#### What Makes them a Fighter?
What type of Fighter is this character? A Fighter can be any sort of warrior. A knight, a ranger, an arcane warrior, an archer, this is a class of possibilities. This is versatility and as a fighter, they may have more possibilities than most. They may be the one to keep going when others can't. Are they a master of arms or a specialist?

#### First Step
A key point in battle is how you fight. The path you take to victory in combat can be exactly what decides your success or failure. Did you emphasize your style on the force behind your blows or the technique and your reflexes behind it?

||~ First Step: Fighter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Deadly force | +1 Strength |
| Reflexive technique | +1 Dexterity |

#### Second Step
When facing a challenge that takes everything you have, what do you rely on? Do you prefer relying on the power that you have or your ability to endure through whatever is ahead of you? Which would get you out alive?

||~ Second Step: Fighter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Physical Power | +1 Strength |
| Enduring Blows | +1 Constitution |

#### Third Step
The foe ahead of you has something dangerous on their weapon. What is your thought? Do you need to focus on avoiding being hit by it at all or believe that your body is strong enough to resist whatever it is?

||~ Third Step: Fighter |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Evasive | +1 Dexterity |
| Resilient  | +1 Constitution |

#### Consider Why You Fight
Why did they choose the weapons they use? Is there a lineage at all to their name? Were they formally trained or did they learn from those they fought? Unlike a lot of the other melee classes you aren't tied down by an emotion, a deity, or a code. Who or what do you fight for?

### The Monk
#### What Makes them a Monk?
What type of monk is this character? Many wield weapons of magic or iron while their body itself is a weapon. What is their monastic style of fighting? Is it graceful or are they more of a brawler? Do they focus more of their energy inwards or outwards? A weapon can exist for many purposes but how it is used can change everything.

#### First Step
In your monastic training, you were required to train both body and mind. Swift movements and graceful actions versus an attentive eye and environmental awareness. Which did you train more?

||~ First Step: Monk |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Swift Movements | +1 Dexterity |
| Attentive eye | +1 Wisdom |

#### Second Step
Your ki flows through your body, a fountain to harness. Finally starting to understand the flow inside you, it has made part of you grow. Did it bolster your health and resistance to internal harm or did it improve attunement to the world around you heightening your intuition?

||~ Second Step: Monk |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Bolstered Health | +1 Constitution |
| World Attunement | +1 Wisdom |

#### Third Step
Your movements, whether fluid or ferocious, have a refinement to them. Whether your approach is focused on speed or endurance is the question. When travelling a distance would your focus be to arrive as quickly as possible or at a reasonable pace without letting yourself become winded?

||~ Third Step: Monk |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Speed | +1 Dexterity |
| Endurance | +1 Constitution |

#### What Is Your Style?
What is your style? Are you strictly kicks or does your character use your opponent's weight against them? Do they target pressure points to cause injury or are they a barrage of force? Are you as graceful with physical weapons? Beyond that, why did your character choose this path? Did someone or something inspire them? What does being a monk mean to them?

### The Mutant (Homebrew)
#### What Makes them a Mutant?
Was your character born with cursed mutations? Did it happen later in life? Was an experiment gone horribly wrong? Was a curse put on them? However it may have happened, they are now a grotesque being, hated by most and feared by all.

#### First Step
What was the first part of them to grow in power, their strength or their ability to consume?

||~ First Step: Mutant |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Consumer | +1 Constitution |
| Destroyer | +1 Strength |

#### Second Step
Did their mutations grant them superhuman strength or superhuman speed?

||~ Second Step: Mutant |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Inhuman Strength | +1 Strength |
| Cursed Speed  | +1 Dexterity |

#### Third Step
An arrow is flying towards you. Do you avoid it or let it sink into your flesh, trusting the wound will heal?

||~ Third Step: Mutant |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Cancerous Healing | +1 Constitution |
| Survival Instincts | +1 Dextterity |

#### Consider How You Look
What do your mutations look like? Are they bulges of flesh that cover your body, countless eyes, tentacles, or something else? How do they make you feel? How do they make others around you feel? Are you attempting to find a cure, or have you embraced your new body?

### The Paladin
#### What Makes them a Paladin?
What type of Paladin is this character? Do they wear armour that signifies an order or have an insignia that represents a portion of their beliefs? Was this something they sought out or did it somehow find them? Are they a paragon of good, a fountain of darkness, or a middle ground? A Paladin doesn’t have to be perfectly “Good” but they can be varying. It could be that they are seeking redemption or pursuing a purpose! Have they taken up arms for a group, for themselves, for a cause, or an entirely different reason?

#### First Step
Paladin training can be difficult! It takes time to strengthen the body but how did you do that? There are plenty of ways to go about training yourself. Do you focus on your physical strength to deal mightier blows or have you focused on improving your stamina and physical resistances?

||~ First Step: Paladin |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Strong Arm | +1 Strength |
| Endured Body | +1 Constitution |

#### Second Step
The Paladin is often seen as a symbol on any battlefield. What sort of symbol are you? Do you see enemies ahead and charge forward with your weapon out to carve a path or do you shout out to those around you so that you force through together as their beacon?

||~ Second Step: Paladin |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Bold Action | +1 Strength |
| Leadership |  +1 Charisma |

#### Third Step
As you’ve come through your Paladin training you were empowered but was it through more of a divine connection or was it your enhanced fortitude? Has your channelled magic become stronger in manifestation and given almost a glamour to your being or have you hardened your body to blows so that you may stand as a wall of defence?

||~ Third Step: Paladin |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Glamorous | +1 Charisma |
| Hardened | +1 Constitution |

#### Consider The Way They See Themself
What weapons does your Paladin use and do they have a variety? Where does this character feel safe and what do they fear? Is their connection to god(s) a good one or is it more like borrowing the power? What do they define as a paladin?

### The Ranger
#### What Makes them a Ranger?
What type of Ranger is this character? Some are an expert of magic, or weapons, or specifically creatures. As a ranger, they've got knowledge of all three but they can become an expert that makes their foes fear them. Whether it is with an animal companion or with a faithful weapon, they can be a guardian, a spell caster from far distances, and even a hunter or monsters most would run from.

#### First Step
Rangers are often specialized in fighting specific creatures. The question is how do you fight them. Do you use the strength you have to overpower them by whatever means and tools you have or is it about your technique; speed, style, and grace being your allies in any combination?

||~ First Step: Ranger |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Overpower | +1 Strength |
| Technique | +1 Dexterity |

#### Second Step
You adapt and survive in harsher elements than most. Would you tie your adaptation to your agility and skills related to such? To move deftly from tree to tree or traverse ice with a little issue or is it your understanding your environment, knowing how to treat the creatures, nature itself, and truly harness survival skills?

||~ Second Step: Ranger |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Strengthened Caster | +1 Strength |
| Natural Caster | +1 Wisdom |

#### Third Step
Magic is your ally. Do you use it to assist your close-quarters conflict and support yourself or is it more than support and an entire array on its own you've focused on?

||~ Third Step: Ranger |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Magical Finesse | +1 Dexterity |
| Support Magic |  +1 Wisdom |

#### How Long Has This Ranger Fought?
Do you belong to a group? Are you someone who has intentionally chosen to be alone or did you belong to a group of rangers? It doesn't even have to just be rangers, but you could have belonged to a group that hunted and fought creatures, beasts, anything of the sort! If you have a favourite enemy, how did you start fighting them? What was your first experience like?

### The Rogue
#### What Makes them a Rogue?
What type of Rogue is this character? Are they the dashing rogue, literally or figuratively? Not every rogue is a thief or assassin. Information can be more valuable than diamonds and rogues can create a vault in their memory that is priceless. Are they an information broker? A thief who found a knack for stealing and loved it? Tell their story!

#### First Step
Are they hidden in the shadows or amongst a crowd hidden in plain sight? Words may be as good as a cloak of Shadow. What is their go-to? How do they disappear or hide?

||~ First Step: Rogue |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Clever Words | +1 Charisma |
| Looming Shadow | +1 Dexterity |

#### Second Step
Your stealth has failed you this time so your choices are limited. You've only got a few options but the question is how do you execute them and get back to a safe spot? Are you relying on your charm to safely get you home or is it your wit and cleverness?

||~ Second Step: Rogue |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Charm | +1 Charisma |
| Cleverness  | +1 Intelligence |

#### Third Step
During a roguish exploit, you've come across a pulsing red orb that is emitting a red glow. Is your reaction to grab it as quickly as possible and escape or to consider what the object is and actually does before acting?

||~ Third Step: Rogue |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Fast Fingers | +1 Dexterity |
| Cautious | +1 Intelligence |

#### Do They See Themselves as a Rogue?
Did they choose this by necessity, excitement, or something else? Do they have a reputation? Do they want a reputation? Would they rather take gold or take hearts? Have they stolen before and if so what have they taken? Do they follow a code or do they take whatever grabs their attention? Are there specific items that catch their attention like magical items, weapons, gems, or even something as mundane as shoes?

### The Sorcerer
#### What Makes them a Sorcerer?
What type of Sorcerer is this character? For some magic is pulled from books, deities, even nature itself, but not so much theirs. Their magic comes from them directly. Whether they were born with it, inherited it, were given it, stole it, or any other means they are the source of their magic. Is it pride that comes with this magic or confusion? What do they think of their own magic?

#### First Step
Your magic has affected your body but in a way of growth. You have become a vessel for magic but in a way that it can be contained and held properly. Did this magic influence your processing of information or bolster the health of its vessel?

||~ First Step: Sorcerer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Info Processing | +1 Intelligence |
| Bolstered Health | +1 Constitution |

#### Second Step
Magic is both a tool and a part of you, although it is not the only thing that you have. When you are in a situation of conflict, but not necessarily dangerous, what do you think of using first? Is this a situation to consider calmly and think it through before acting with your power or is using magic quickly before the situation gets worse your action?

||~ Second Step: Sorcerer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Calm Decision | +1 Intelligence |
| Magical Action | +1 Charisma |

#### Third Step
The body has limits and though yours contains a fountain of magic that does not mean it is endless. The usefulness of magic has variety but if the caster cannot continue on then the magic cannot be used. Has your focus been on raising your endurance or enhancing the magical power you can release?

||~ Third Step: Sorcerer |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Physical Endurance | +1 Constitution |
| Magical Power | +1 Charisma |

#### Consider Your Magic's Origins
Your magic has become as natural a part of you as the essence of your life. Does it manifest like the origin of your magic? Do glowing eyes appears with a color that resembles an emotion? Does an aura emit from your body or sensations ripple through the air itself?

### The Spellblade (Homebrew)
#### What Makes them a Spellblade?
Why do they fight? Why do they infuse their combat prowess with arcane magic? Is it to cover up their weaknesses, or amplify their strength? Did they learn their skills themselves, or did they receive training from a master?

#### First Step
You're proficient with many weapons. Which do you prefer; power or speed?

||~ First Step: Spellblade |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Power | +1 Strength |
| Speed | +1 Dexterity |

#### Second Step
Your magic is learned through hard work and study, but so is your strength. Which of the two do you focus on?

||~ Second Step: Spellblade |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Enhanced Strength | +1 Strength |
| Enhanced Study | +1 Intelligence |

#### Third Step
Your blades require runes to be inscribed into them. Do you prefer doing it quickly, or taking your time, making sure you do it by the book?

||~ Third Step: Spellblade |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Speedy Carver | +1 Dexterity |
| By the Book | +1 Intelligence |

#### Consider Your Fighting Style
How do you fight? Are you in the middle of the action, dishing out and taking damage? Do you prefer hit-and-run tactics? Perhaps you prefer staying at the sidelines, picking of enemies from afar? Perhaps you focus on keeping your allies alive with magic?

### The Warlock
#### What Makes them a Warlock?
What type of Warlock is this character? Have they been connected to this entity since birth or was it a choice later on in their life? How much do they offer up in service? There is knowledge to discover all over and they have channelled someone (or something) that will give them the power to pursue to that knowledge. Their pact will not determine their fate, but it will open up paths for them. Only they determine fate.

#### First Step
Your patron has bestowed upon a gift. This gift is a blessing to their conduit who acts in their stead. Is the blessing one that enriched your physical body and bolstered your health or was it one that added a bit of glamour to your words?

||~ First Step: Warlock |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Enhanced Body | +1 Constitution |
| Glamorous Boon | +1 Charisma |

#### Second Step
When you grow stronger so does your patron, although you will occasionally be faced with danger beyond what you can handle it alone. Do you face it head-on until you succeed while less considering caution and showing your warlock ability with no hesitation or try and harness your agility to avoid danger and find an escape?

||~ Second Step: Warlock |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Steadfast | +1 Constitution |
| Nimble | +1 Dexterity |

#### Third Step
Some patrons grant their warlocks weaponry and some go so far as gifting them weaponry powered specifically by their bond. Many magic beings can attack from a distance with ease so as a warlock, do you focus primarily on your warlock arsenal of magic or would you rely comfortably on a ranged weapon of material creation?

||~ Third Step: Warlock |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Focused Caster | +1 Charisma |
| Adaptable Mage | +1 Dexterity |

#### What is the Bond with Your Patron Like?
Why did your patron bestow this magic? How does your magic manifest and when it does is there some glimpse of the patron’s influence? Is this bond one that is completely wanted? Do you and your patron have a relationship where you communicate or is it more like working under a ruler who you serve when they call?

### The Wizard
#### What Makes them a Wizard?
What type of Wizard is this character? Often for them, in many ways, magic is an understanding. A comprehension of how it all ties together. Is this character a wizard who has the main focus of spell type or are they a wizard that aims to be flexible? Embrace their magic and create things beyond the fantasy world has seen. Shape it in unique ways!

#### First Step
Their mind is a strong piece to a powerful tool but so is their ability to gain the resources that they need. When it comes to spell weaving what is this character more capable of? Is it the comprehension of spell components and how they blend or the social understanding and ability to get the components they need and preferably for a reasonable price?

||~ First Step: Wizard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Spell Source | +1 Intelligence |
| Component Shopper | +1 Charisma |

#### Second Step
Some have no use for a spellbook at all and those who draw power from even more terrifying beings. As their magic grows so does their defence against those other types of magic. Would you say they have spent more time in preparing against magic to affect their will and memory or magic that twisted their bonds and personality?

||~ Second Step: Wizard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Strong Will | +1 Wisdom |
| Strong Heart | +1 Charisma |

#### Third Step
You found an unknown magical item! The question is what do they do with it next? Is now the time to consider longevity? What would be the wisest decision for it? Is this purely something new for the world and it is up to them to decide if the smartest choice is to keep it secret or share it? Do they consider making what feels the wisest choice or the smartest?

||~ Third Step: Wizard |
|Step |Ability Score Increase |
|---|---|
| Smart Choices | +1 Intelligence |
| Wise Choice | +1 Wisdom |

#### Consider The way Your Magic Grows
Do you manually write in your spellbook or spells write themselves? Is their magic precise and defined or spontaneous and predictable? Is there a colour to their magic when it manifests and is there other visible cues as it sparks to life?
