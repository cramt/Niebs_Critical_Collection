#SorcererRework
***Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.***

***This is an optional rework for the Sorcerer. The intent is to make the class stand more on its own and bring it up to the same level as the other full casters, hopefully without going too far. It is recommended only for experienced players, and I would highly recommend reading through the spellcasting rules that are listed for this class.***

*You must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

# Class Features
As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per sorcerer level
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None
**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
**Tools:** None
**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- Two daggers

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 3d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### Spellcasting
An event in your past, or the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Sorcerer\|sorcerer spell list]]. You learn additional Sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

#### Sorcery Points
You gain a pool of 4 Sorcery Points that you can use to cast spells (and later manipulate their properties through your Metamagic feature).

When you wish to cast a spell you expend a number of Sorcery Points to create a spell slot of a given level as indicated on the Sorcery Points cost table, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can’t reduce your Sorcery Points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent Sorcery Points when you finish a long rest.

||~ Sorcery Points Cost |
|Spell Slot Level |Sorcery Points Cost |
|---|---|
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
| 6th | 9 |
| 7th | 10 |
| 8th | 11 |
| 9th | 13 |

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Burning Hands\|Burning Hands]], you can cast the spell by expending 2 Sorcery Points.

The number of Sorcery Points you have to spend increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sorcery Points column on the sorcerer class table.

#### Maximum Spell level
As your level increases, so does your power. Your sorcerer level also determines the maximum level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can’t do so.

#### Casting Spells of 6th level and Higher
Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use Sorcery Points to create one slot of each level of 6th level or higher. You can’t create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.

[[dnd5e/!  ++++\|Spell Fatigue
Casting the same spell several times in a row quickly tires out one's mind. Attempting to cast the same spell too many times in a row can quickly drain your magical reserves.

If you attempt to cast the same spell at the same spell level too many times within 1 minute, the cost of casting will exponentially increase. This only applies to spells of 1st level or higher.

||~ Spell Fatigue |
|~ Number of Casts within 1 minute |~ Sorcery Points Cost Multiplier |
| 1 | 1x |
| 2 | 1x |
| 3 | 2x |
| 4 | 4x |
| 5 | 8x |
| 6 | 16x |
| 7 | 32x |
| 8 | 64x |
--]]

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Sorcerer\|sorcerer spell list]].

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can create spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn two new spells of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Sorcerer\|sorcerer spell list]], which also must be of a level for which you can create spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus or your own body as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

### Sorcerous Origin
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power:
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Aberrant Mind\|Aberrant Mind]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Alloy Warrior\|Alloy Warrior (Homebrew)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Clockwork Soul\|Clockwork Soul]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Draconic Bloodline\|Draconic Bloodline]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Divine Soul\|Divine Soul]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Giant Soul\|Giant Soul (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Haunted\|Haunted (GH)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Ley Line\|Ley Line (Homebrew)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Necrotic Bloodline\|Necrotic Bloodline (Homebrew)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Phoenix\|Phoenix (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Pyromancy\|Pyromancy (Kaladesh)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Runechild\|Runechild (MM)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Sea\|Sea (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Shadow\|Shadow]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Stone\|Stone (UA)]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Storm\|Storm]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Wild Magic\|Wild Magic]]
- [[dnd5e/Sorcerer/Wretched Bloodline\|Wretched Bloodline (GH)]]
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Arcane Absorption
Starting at 2nd level, you can absorb some of the magical energies from the world around you to regain some of your spent power. You can choose to spend one or more unspent Hit Dice at the end of a Short Rest, up to your maximum number of Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain spent Sorcery Points equal to the total and you cannot exceed your Sorcery Point maximum as shown on the Sorcerer Table. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

### Metamagic
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 5th, 10th, and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

##### • Augmented Spell (Homebrew)
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 4 sorcery points to change the first saving throw required for one target of the spell. If the original save is a physical attribute, such as Strength, Consitution, or Dexterity, you must choose one from that group. Similarly, if the original save is a mental attribute, such as Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, it must remain one.

##### • Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

##### • Delayed Spell (Homebrew)
When you cast a spell, you can delay it occurring until the start of your next turn by spending 1 sorcery point, expending the spell slot as normal when initially casting the spell. When the start of your next turn begins, you can choose to delay it once more, for 1 more sorcery points. Delaying a spell requires your concentration.

##### • Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

##### • Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### • Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

##### • Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

##### • Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

##### • Seeking Spell
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.
You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### • Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

##### • Transmuted Spell
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder. 

##### • Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible for Twinned Spell, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level.

### Font of Magic
At 3rd level, you can use an action to regain all of your spent Sorcery Points. You can use this feature again after you complete a long rest.

Starting at 9th level, you can use this feature twice between long rests.

### Flexible Casting
At 3rd level, you gain additional ways of manipulating the power that resides within you.

***Imbuing Touch.*** As a bonus action, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 Sorcery Points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

***Sorcerous Fortitude.*** As an action, you can spend a number of Sorcery Points up to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

### Sorcerous Versatility
Starting at 4th level, Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing the magic within you flowing in new ways:
* Replace one of the options you chose for the Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic option available to you.
* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the sorcerer spell list.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo increasing your ability scores at a given level to take a [[dnd5e/Feats\|feat]] of your choice instead.

### Magical Guidance
At 5th level, you can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try to conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

### Sorcerous Restoration
At 20th level, whenever you use your Font of Magic feature, you regain 2 spent Sorcery Points at the start of each your turns for 1 minute or until you use the feature again.
