#StarterFeats
Some feats see little use in the game, even though they add a lot of fun variety to combat, therefore, some classes will have the ability to start with certain feats.

* These classes gain these feats, in addition to their level 1 character feats.
* You can gain any number of these feats.
* You can ask the DM if you want to exchange your given feat with another feat.
* You must still meet the feat's given prerequisites.
* You **do not** gain any ability score improvements from any of the feats.
* You **do not** gain any of these feats when multiclassing, unless you've made an agreement with the dm.
* All of this also applies to NPCs.
