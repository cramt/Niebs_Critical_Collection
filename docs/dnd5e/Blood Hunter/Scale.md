#BloodHunter
***The Order of the Scale focus on tracking down and defeating dragons. By utilizing the pure elemental energy of dragons against them, they somehow manage to strike fear into the hearts of the all-powerful dragons.***

### Dragon's Bane
When you join this order at 3rd level, you undergo a version of the Hunter's Bane based from dragon's blood. The benefits of your Hunter's Bane feature apply to Dragons in addition to the usual creature types, and you can speak, read, and write Draconic.

In addition, choose the type of dragon your Dragon's Bane is brewed from, and reference the Draconic Features table below for your Order of the Scale features.

### Elemental Affinity
Also at 3rd level, as the draconic blood alters your body, you gain the following benefits: 
**Damage Resistance.** You gain damage resistance to your chosen Draconic damage type. 
**Draconic Rites.** You learn the Primal Rite associated with that type of dragon, and when you damage a creature with this rite, you can roll your hemocraft die twice and use the higher number rolled. If you already know this rite, you may learn another Primal Rite of your choice.

Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now strengths elemental magics around it, using them to bind your foe to you. When you damage a branded creature with your draconic damage type, they suffer additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. In addition,  whenever you hit the branded creature with an attack, the branded creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Hemocraft save DC or have its fly speed becomes 0, if it has one, until the beginning of your next turn.

### Great Drake's Bane
At 15th level, you consume an even more powerful version of the Dragon's Bane, further infusing yourself with draconic qualities. You gain blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.

You also gain the Blood Curse of the Wyrm for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.

### Draconic Call
When you reach 18th level, you gain the ability to call lesser dragons to your side as both ally and mount. Once per long rest, you can cast the spell [[dnd5e/Spell/Find Greater Steed\|Find Greater Steed]], though the form you choose can only be that of a dragon wyrmling.

The specific wyrmling is dependent on your alignment, good aligned character may only summon good aligned wyrmlings, and similarly for evil aligned characters.

Finally, when summoned in this way, the wyrmling is considered a Large creature.
