#BloodHunter
***Of all the Orders of Blood Hunter, the Order of the Inquisition is the most accepted by the crown. Working closely with the law, the Inquisition has been given much leeway in their fight against corruption.***

***Most Orders specialize in hunting down different monsters, threats to humanity. However, this order understands that humanity themselves are the true monsters. They specialize in hunting spellcasters and those who seek to corrupt the world through magic. The biggest threats to an orderly and peaceful society come from within, and these must be cut out of the world like the cancer they are.***

### Hunter of Men
When you join this order at 3rd level, your time spent hunting down people has made you easily able to read their intentions. You may roll a die equal to your Hemocraft die and add it to any Wisdom (Insight) or Wisdom (Perception) checks made toward humanoids.

### Awakened Blood
When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn to channel pain into heightened or even ethereal senses, to assist your search for heresy in its many forms. As an action, you can cast the following spells by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your Hemocraft die: [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Evil And Good\|Detect Evil and Good]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Poison And Disease\|Detect Poison and Disease]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/See Invisibility\|See Invisibility]]. Your hemocraft ability is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you reach 7th level, you can channel this ability to effect others as well. You may use this feature to cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Thoughts\|Detect Thoughts]], or [[dnd5e/Spell/Hold Person\|Hold Person]]. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or long rest

### Traitors Abound
At 7th level, the paranoia instilled by your order has proven useful, keeping your mind clear and ready to act at the first sign of danger. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, and you have advantage on initiative rolls.

### Fury of the Righteous
Starting at 11th level, the weight of all you have seen and done can be channeled into pure fury. As a reaction to you or an ally within 15 feet falling below half their maximum hit points, you can enter into a fanatical state.

In this state, your speed is increased by 10 feet, your Crimson Rite deals one additional Hemocraft die of rite damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier at the start of each of your turns (minimum of 1). These benefits last for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious.

Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Brand of Unfocused Thought
Beginning at 15th level, your Brand of Castigation now disrupts the focus of creatures affected by it. The branded creature cannot take reactions, and if they are concentrating on a spell at the start of their turn, they take psychic damage equal to a roll of your Hemocraft die.

### Blood Curse of the Burning Witch
Once you reach 18th level, your blood curse can burn heretics where they stand. You gain the Blood Curse of the Burning Witch for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.
