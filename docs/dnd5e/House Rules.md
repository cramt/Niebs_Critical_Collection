#HouseRules
***This is a set of house rules that apply to games I run. They apply in addition to all the normal rules, and some even addend already existing rules.***

#### Dropping To 0 Hit-points
* When a character falls below 0 hit-points, they fall unconscious as by the default rules.

* The rules for instant death by massive damage still apply.

* Death saves, however, **are rolled by the dm.** Results are not given to the players.

* If a character stabilizes or is brought back to consciousness by any means, such as healing spells and abilities, they gain 1 level of exhaustion.

#### Resurrection
* Magic that restores life requires a DC 10 skill check on the caster’s spellcasting ability. Success increases the DC for any future attempt by 1. The other characters can help in a ritual to lower the DC. A check is made by the assisting character depending on the nature of the help. A successful check lowers the DC and failure increases it. Failure of the spellcaster’s final check leaves the spirit beyond reach.
