### Primordial Envoy
At 1st level you learn the ability to speak, read and write primordial and all its dialects, Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran.

You give elementals a much better first impression than other mortals meaning elementals who would normally be hostile to mortals are neutral towards you or generally neutral elementals are friendly with you.

### Elemental Favour
At first level you know the elements of fire, earth, as and water, additional elements can be gained from your shamanic teachings or in later levels 

At the end of a long rest you can gain the favour of one of the elements you know. The favour lasts until the end of your next long rest or until you gain the favour of another element. You can gain favour with additional elements at once as shown on the Elemental Favour salumn on Shaman Table. 

In this class you will gain special features known as [[dnd5e/Shaman/Favour Features\|favour features]], these features will have different effects based on which favours you currently hold.

### Armaments of The Pure Ones
(this is a [[dnd5e/Shaman/Favour Features\|favour feature]])
at 1st level you gain the ability to enhance weapons and armor with primordial power, you can apply the elements you have available as a bonus action, however only 1 of each element can be active at a time, the effect lasts for 10 minutes.

### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on primordial magic through meditation and focus to cast spells.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your shaman level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level shaman, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell EXAMPLE, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since their power derives your connection with primordial spirits. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Primordial Conduits
At 2nd level you have seen many things on your travels and learn how to create [[dnd5e/Shaman/Primordial Conduits\|primordial conduits]]. You gain two primordial conduits of your choice. When you gain certain shaman levels, you gain additional conduits of your choice, as shown in the Conduits Known column of the Shaman table.

As a bonus action, you can activate and place one of your known conduits in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 15 feet of you. Once you activate a conduit, you cannot use the same type of conduit again until you finish a long rest, it stays active as long as you’re within 100 feet of it.

A conduit is a magical object with an AC based on its type and Hit Points equal to 5 + three times your Shaman level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. You can dismiss it early as a free action.


### Fighting Style
At 2nd level you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### • Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

##### • Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### • Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

##### • Superior Technique
You learn one maneuver of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Fighter/Maneuvers\|list of Maneuvers]]. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it.
You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

##### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

##### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### • Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
