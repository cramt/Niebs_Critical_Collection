#Lineages
### What are Lineages?
Lineages are races that characters might gain through remarkable events. These overshadow their original race, if any, becoming their new race. A character might choose a lineage during character creation, their transformation having occurred before play begins. Or, events might unfold during adventures that lead your character to replace their race with this new lineage. Work with your DM to establish if you're amenable to such a development and how such stories unfold.

### Creating Your Character
At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. Alternatively, you can choose a lineage. If you choose a lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you aren't any longer. You now possess only your lineage's racial traits.

When you create a character using a lineage option, follow these additional rules during character creation.

#### Ability Score Increase
When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.

#### Languages
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.

#### Creature Type
Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented tells you what your character's creature type is. If an option does not provide a creature type, your character has the Humanoid creature type.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the [[dnd5e/Spell/Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]] spell specifies that the spell doesn't work in a creature of the Construct type.
