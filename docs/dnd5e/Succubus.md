#Succubus
***Succubi are the iconic depiction of lust. Feared for their typically evil nature and ability to steal one's soul, succubi are fiends who wield subtle illusions and enchantments to tempt their victims into forfeiting their eternal souls. Succubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.***

***Succubi often live up to their reputation, acting as seductive females or males to lure males and/or females into relinquishing some of their life-force. Particularly adept at controlling others in the peak of their strength, they're often employed - albeit reluctantly - by others to act as crowd control, or to tame certain creatures. Most of them share the nature of their reputation; flirtatious. They avoid fighting where possible, instead choosing seduction or fleeing.***

### Succubus Traits
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity and Charisma scores increase by 1.

- **Age.** Succubi are ageless demons, typically reaching adulthood between the ages of 15 and 19 and will not die of old age.

- **Alignment.** Due to their fiendish natures, succubi often tend toward evil alignments. Neutral or good succubi are extremely rare, but not unheard of. They have no particularly tendency toward or against lawful or chaotic alignments.

- **Size.** Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** Because you are a fiend, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Charm.** You can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Charm Person\|charm person]] spell once using this trait, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. You regain the ability to cast this spell when you finish a long or short rest.

- **Fiendish Nature.** Your creature type is considered to be both Fiend and Humanoid, and you are considered to have the Shapechanger tag. Additionally, you are vulnerable to radiant damage.

- **Shapechanger.** As an action, you can polymorph into any humanoid of your size that you have seen or back into your true form. However, your equipment does not change with you. You lose the fly speed granted by your small wings trait if your current form does not have wings. If you die, you revert to your natural appearance.

- **Silver Tongue.** You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill.

- **Small Wings.** You have a small pair of wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. However, these wings are not strong enough to hold you weight for an extended period of time. You fall if you end your turn in midair, you started in midair, and nothing else is holding you aloft.

- **Languages.** You can read, speak, and write Common and your choice of Abyssal or Infernal.
