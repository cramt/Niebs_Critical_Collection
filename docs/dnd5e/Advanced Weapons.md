#AdvancedWeapons
### Advanced Weapons
Warriors of all stripes have developed sophisticated techniques, turning weapons of straightforward but precise design more deadly. Advanced weapons comprise both practices, from new weapons to novel ways of using familiar ones. To function as it should, each advanced weapon must be made with exactness, and each one is a masterpiece of the craft required to produce it. Hence, each advanced weapon has a high price. The Advanced Weapon Table summarizes these armaments and their unique uses. Descriptions of these weapons’ properties include more details.

#### Advanced Weapon Training
Mastery of advanced weapons requires military training and skill. To use most weapons’ advanced properties, you must be 3rd level or higher and have proficiency with all martial weapons. At 3rd level or higher, if you would gain proficiency with a martial weapon, you can choose an advanced weapon instead.

#### Advanced Weapon Properties
The following properties are new or altered for advanced weapons. If an Advanced Weapon's property is not listed below, use the standard rule for the property. See the [[dnd5e/Weapons\|Standard Weapons]] page for more details.

***Armor Piercing.*** An armor-piercing weapon is a melee weapon designed to punch through armor and thick hide alike. When you make an attack roll using an armor-piercing weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if your target is wearing armor or has natural armor.

***Brutal.*** A brutal weapon is designed for maximum damage. When you score a critical hit with a brutal weapon against a creature, you can roll an additional die of the weapon’s damage dice, adding it to the damage total.

***Cumbersome.*** Cumbersome weapons are difficult to wield but are effective ranged tools for those strong enough to wield them. When making an attack with a cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Damage. An advanced weapon that has the damage property can deal an alternative form of damage. You can choose the type when you attack or when you hit with an attack from any of the damage types mentioned.

***Defending.*** A defending weapon is either made for parrying, has advanced techniques for use in parrying, or both. When you use a defending weapon, you can use your reaction to defend against a melee weapon attack that hits you. If you do, increase your AC by 1d4 against that attack.

***Disarming.*** A disarming weapon can catch a foe’s weapon, allowing you to remove it from their grasp. When an opponent misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt to disarm them. Both you and the attacker must make contested attack rolls. If you roll higher, and the weapon is something the target can drop, the weapon falls from the target’s grasp, landing within 5 feet of the target in a space you choose. If you score a critical hit, and the attacker did not, you can send the weapon flying up to 15 feet away from the target into a space you choose instead. If you have a free hand when you score a critical hit this way, you can disarm the target so that you end up with the dropped weapon in your hand. If the attacker tied or rolled higher, then nothing happens.

***Double.*** A two-handed, double weapon functions as two light weapons, one in each hand, for two-weapon fighting purposes. If a double weapon has the reach property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

***Entangling.*** An entangling weapon can tie a target up. When you hit with an entangling weapon attack against a target no more than one size larger than you, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. (This bonus-action use applies when you throw an entangling weapon because you’re throwing with special preparation.) You don’t need a free hand—the weapon fulfills that requirement. If you succeed, the target is grappled by you or the weapon if you’re no longer holding it.

Until the grapple ends, you can’t use the entangling weapon to attack a different target. If you aren’t holding the entangling weapon, such as when you throw a gladiator net, the grapple continues, and the target needs to succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to escape the weapon.

***Guard.*** Guard weapons allow you to fight defensively, using the weapon’s long haft or flat surface for parrying. While you wield a guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach when you didn’t move on your last turn, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack with the guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, but the target immediately stops moving, and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.

***Hafted.*** A hafted weapon’s haft can function well as an off-hand attack. When you attack with only the hafted weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the haft. The haft deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage as you would for other sorts of two-weapon fighting. If you have feats that mimic this ability, the damage dice becomes 1d8 instead.

***Magazine.*** A weapon with the magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammo, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. Removing or loading a magazine counts as your interaction with an object, so doing both in one turn takes an action. A magazine weapon comes with one empty magazine included in the weapon’s cost and weight. Loading an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

***Momentum.*** Momentum weapons allow you to deliver devastating attacks as part of rapid movement. When you hit a creature with a momentum weapon after you moved 20 feet or more in a straight line during the same turn, upgrade the damage dice to the weapon’s momentum dice value.

***Monk.*** A monk gains proficiency with advanced monk weapons at 5th level.

***Precise.*** When you attack with a precise weapon, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a feature or item you have increases the numbers you can roll for a critical hit, a precise weapon increases that range by one. A fighter with Superior Critical, for instance, scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20 with a precise weapon. Any roll lower than 20 must still hit to be a critical hit—it’s not an automatic hit as if the roll was a 20.

***Reach.*** Besides the normal rules for this property, if a reach weapon has the double property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

***Repeater.*** Repeater weapons can fire ammo in quick succession, using multiple barrels or quick-reloading mechanisms. When you take the attack action with a repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You add your ability modifier to the damage the bonus-action shot only if that modifier is negative.

***Restraining.*** Only entangling weapons can be restraining weapons. If you have a target grappled with a restraining weapon, and you succeed on another attempt to grapple the target with the same weapon, the target becomes restrained instead of grappled. The target then remains restrained until the grapple ends. If you stop holding the restraining weapon, the target can escape as if from an unheld entangling weapon.

***Returning.*** A returning weapon allows you to hurl the weapon in such a way that it returns to you. When you attack with a returning weapon, if you roll an even number on the d20, the weapon returns to you by the end of your turn. You can catch the weapon if you have a hand free to do so. If not, the weapon lands at a random point within 5 feet of you. If you roll an odd number on the d20 for the attack roll, the weapon fails to return to you.

***Set.*** You can use a bonus action on your turn to prepare, or “set,” a set weapon against a foe moving toward you. A weapon becomes unset if you move or take any action after setting it. If a target enters your reach while you have the weapon set, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the set weapon against that target. If you hit, and your target moved 20 feet or more toward you before the attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage total.

***Strong-Draw.*** An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage. You add not only your Dexterity modifier to damage with a strong-draw weapon, but you also add 1 + half your Strength Modifier (rounded down) to the damage.

***Swift.*** Swift weapons help you recover quickly from misses. When you miss with a swift weapon, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make with the weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn.

***Tripping.*** A tripping weapon allows users to knock targets prone. When you hit with a tripping weapon, you can use a bonus action to force your target to attempt a Strength saving throw, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If the target fails, it falls prone.

### Advanced Ammunition Training
Much as some folk have created advanced weapons and techniques, so too have they created ammunition to deal specialized damage. To utilize advanced ammunition, you must have proficiency in the weapon that uses the ammo, and you must be 3rd level or higher.

#### Advanced Ammunition Types
Most advanced ammunition is self-explanatory. A few special types are explained here.

#### Damage Types
Advanced ammunition named after a damage type deals that damage type. Arrows and bolts can have wide, slashing heads or heavy, bludgeoning tips. A sling bullet can have piercing facets. All such ammo is heavier than normal, so the weapon’s maximum range using it is half normal.

#### Ranging
Ammunition that has the ranging property is lighter and better made than common counterparts. When you fire ranging ammo, you can increase your weapon’s normal range by 50 percent.

#### Whistling
Ammunition with the whistling property creates a high-pitched sound after firing. This sound is audible for 300 feet from the ammo as it flies. Whistling ammo isn’t heavier, but it catches the air in baffles to create its sound, so its maximum range is half normal. Whistling ammo deals bludgeoning damage.

#### Alchemical Advanced Ammunition
Alchemical ammunition carries an alchemical payload. Rather than hurling a vial as an improvised weapon, you fire alchemical ammunition from a projectile weapon, using your normal attack bonus with that weapon. Alchemical ammunition deals the ammo’s normal damage type in addition to delivering the alchemical effect. This ammo is heavy though, so a weapon’s maximum range using alchemical ammo is half normal. The alchemical ammunition is destroyed once used, whether the attack hits or misses.

***Acid, Alchemist’s Fire, and Holy Water***. Other than how you hit a creature using alchemical ammo, these substances have their normal effects.

***War Oil.*** When you fire war-oil ammo at an area and hit AC 10, viscous oil covers the area within 5 feet of a point you target. If you target a creature, you must hit that creature’s AC to cover the creature in war oil. But if you hit the creature or AC 10, you can pick a point in or adjacent to that creature’s space to determine the war oil’s area as if you targeted a point.

War oil’s area is difficult terrain. A creature standing in the area when it appears, that starts its turn in the area, or that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

War oil is also flammable. If lit, such as by dealing fire damage to a creature covered in the oil, the oil burns for 2 rounds. Burning war oil deals 2d4 fire damage to any creature ignited in this way. An ignited creature can douse the flames by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames. If the creature ends its turn still aflame, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage. If war oil ignites in an area, a creature takes fire 1d4 damage when it enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in that area. A creature can take fire damage from war oil only once per round.

War oil dries and ceases to be slippery or flammable after 1 minute.

#### Specialized Ammunition Properties
The following advanced ammunition properties impart more effectiveness to ammunition. Each piece of specialized ammunition can have only one of these properties. Because of the crafting skills required to make this ammunition, it is much more expensive.

***Armor Piercing.*** This ammunition works like an armour piercing melee weapon, but you fire the ammunition as a projectile from a ranged weapon.

***Blessed.*** When you hit a fiend, fey, or undead with blessed ammunition, that creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. Also the creature can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.

***Brutal.*** Designed to open wide wounds, such as with a broad-bladed arrowhead, brutal ammunition works like a brutal melee weapon.

***Incendiary.*** When you hit a creature with incendiary ammunition, the target takes an additional 1d4 fire damage.

***Silvered.*** Treat attacks you make with silvered ammunition as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
