#Feat
**Hardy and resilient, you gain the following benefits:**

* Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).

* When you gain a level of exhaustion, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you instead do not gain the level of exhaustion.

* Addition: You have advantage on death saving throws. If you would ever suffer instant death, you are instead reduced to 0 hit points and suffer a death saving throw failure. 

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.*

* *When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).*
