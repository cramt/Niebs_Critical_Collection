#Feat
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with at least 1 firearm with the Scatter property.*

**Where others took guns as a tool for precision, you missed that memo and decided you didn't need to be accurate, granting you the following benefits:**

* When using a firearm with the scatter property, you do not suffer disadvantage from being within 5ft. of an enemy.
* You can add your normal damage modifier to damage dealt from the Scatter property to a second target.
* When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a scatter weapon, you can reroll it and must take the new result. This also applies to damage dealt to a secondary target through the scatter property.
