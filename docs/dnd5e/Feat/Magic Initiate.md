#Feat
Choose a class: bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's list.

In addition, you learn one 1st level spell from the same list. You can cast it at its lowest level; once cast, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.  You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Your spellcasting modifier for these spells is the same as the class you chose (Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; Intelligence for wizard).
