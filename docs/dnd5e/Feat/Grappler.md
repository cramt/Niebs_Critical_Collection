#Feat
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher.*

**You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:**

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling and creatures you have successfully shoved since the beginning of your previous turn.

* Your speed is no longer halved when moving a grappled creature with you.

* When you make an opportunity attack, you can make a grapple attack instead of a weapon attack. If you succeed, they are not grappled, but you stop any movement they may have been taking.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.*

* *You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.*
