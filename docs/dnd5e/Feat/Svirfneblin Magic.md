#Feat
*Prerequisite: Gnome (Deep Gnome).*

**You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors.**

This ability allows you to cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Nondetection\|Nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[dnd5e/Spell/Blindness Deafness\|Blindness/Deafness]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Blur\|Blur]], and [[dnd5e/Spell/Disguise Self\|Disguise Self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
