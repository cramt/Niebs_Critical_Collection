#Feat
**You have spent time studying how to blend magic into your swordplay, granting you the following benefits:**

* You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Spellblade\|spellblade spell list]], and you learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from that list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

* You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without consuming a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

* You gain proficiency with one type of simple or martial weapon of your choice, and you can use that type of weapon as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability.
