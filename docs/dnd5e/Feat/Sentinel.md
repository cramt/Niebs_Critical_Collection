#Feat
**You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:**

* Whenever you hit a large or smaller creature with an opportunity attack, its speed drops to 0 for the rest of the turn. This stops any movement they may have been taking.

* Creatures within your reach provoke opportunity attacks even if they took the Disengage action.

* When a creature within your reach makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.*

* *Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.*

* *When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.*
