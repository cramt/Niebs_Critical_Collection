#Feat
**Your extensive study of nature rewards you with the following benefits:**

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You gain proficiency in the Nature skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.

* You learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Druidcraft\|Druidcraft]] and [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Poison\|Detect Poison]] and [[dnd5e/Spell/Disease\|Disease]] spells. You can cast Detect Poison and Disease once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
