#Feat
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher.*

Whenever you roll a melee attack against a creature with a two-handed weapon and reduce it to 0 hit points, you can have any remaining damage carry over to another creature within range, if your original attack roll was high enough to hit the second creature. If you reduce the second creature to 0 hit points, you can carry the damage to a third creature and so forth.
