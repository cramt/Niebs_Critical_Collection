#Feat
**You have uncanny aim with attacks that rely on precision rather than brute force. You gain the following benefits:**

* Increase your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll using Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, you can reroll one of the dice once.

*Note that this is a slight revision of the [[dnd5e/Feat/Elven Accuracy\|Elven Accuracy]] feat that simply removes the Elf or Half-elf requirement.*
