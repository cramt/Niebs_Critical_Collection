#Feat
**You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:**

* Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

* Your ranged weapons ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

* Before you make a ranged attack with a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If you do so and the attack hits, it deals +10 damage.
