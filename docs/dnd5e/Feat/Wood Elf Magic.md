#Feat
*Prerequisite: Elf (Wood).*

**You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people.**

You learn one Druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Longstrider\|Longstrider]] and [[dnd5e/Spell/Pass Without Trace\|Pass Without Trace spells]], each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
