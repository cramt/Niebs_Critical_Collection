#Feat
**You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:**

* You learn two [[dnd5e/Fighter/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] of your choice from the Battle Master archetype. If the maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

* You gain 3 superiority dice (if you don't already have superiority dice, they are d6s, otherwise these dice are added to any superiority dice you have from another source). These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. They are expended when you use them, and are regained when you finish a short or long rest.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *You learn two maneuvers of your choice from the Battle Master archetype. If the maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).*

* *You gain 1 superiority die (if you don't already have superiority dice, it is a d6). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. It is expended when you use it, and is regained when you finish a short or long rest.*
