#Feat
**You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:**

* You have advantage on melee attack rolls against unmounted creatures that are smaller than your mount while mounted.

* You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead or vice-versa.

* If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds and half damage if it fails.

* If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Wisdom saving throw, it has advantage on the roll.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *You have advantage on melee attack rolls against unmounted creatures that are smaller than your mount.*

* *You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.*

* *If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds and half damage if it fails.*
