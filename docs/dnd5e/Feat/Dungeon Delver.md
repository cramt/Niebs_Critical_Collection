#Feat
**Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:**

* Increase your Wisdom or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You automatically detect the presence of non-magical secret doors within 15 feet of you.
 
* You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.

* You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.

* Traveling at a fast pace doesnâ€™t impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.

* You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

* You always know which way is north.

* You always know the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) made to detect the presence of secret doors.*
 
* *You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.*

* *You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.*

* *You can search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only at a slow pace.*
