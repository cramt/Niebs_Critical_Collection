#Feat
* You increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

You can use your bonus action to Dash, with the following conditions and benefits while moving in this way:
* You can only move in one general direction.
* You can move through the space of any creature as if they were an ally.
* You have resistance to damage caused by opportunity attacks.
* If you move at least 10 feet, you may attempt to shove a creature within reach with advantage. On a success, you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you and/or knock them prone.


*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

*When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attackâ€™s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).*
