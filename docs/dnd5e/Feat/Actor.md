#Feat
**Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:**

* Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person, or mimic the sounds of another creature.

* If you take the Help action to aid an ally attacking a creature, you can do so from up to 30 feet away if the creature can hear or see you.

* You gain proficiency with Performance, disguise kits and weaverâ€™s tools.

*Note that this feat has been reworked for my games. The base version, which is not allowed, looks like this:*

* *Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.*

* *You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.*

* *You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.*
