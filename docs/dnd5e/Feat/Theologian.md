#Feat
**Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits:**

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.

* You learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Thaumaturgy\|Thaumaturgy]] and [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Evil And Good\|Detect Evil and Good]] spells. You can cast detect evil and good once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
