**You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:**

* Increase the ability score you use for spellcasting by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you cast a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.

* Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
