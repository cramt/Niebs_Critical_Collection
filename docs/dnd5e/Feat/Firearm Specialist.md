#Feat
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with at least 1 firearm.*

**You are adept at using guns effectively.**

* If you roll a misfire on an attack with a firearm, you can use your reaction to roll a d20. If the number rolled is higher than the weaponâ€™s misfire score, the firearm does not misfire. You cannot use this feature of this feat again until you complete a short or long rest.

* When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded firearm with the light property you are holding.
