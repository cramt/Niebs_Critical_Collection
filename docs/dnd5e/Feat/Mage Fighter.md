#Feat
**You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits:**

* When a creature within 5 feet of you casts a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or longer, doesn't have a range of self or touch, and that isn't a melee spell attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

* You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet, as long as you are aware that a spell is being cast and can see the caster.
