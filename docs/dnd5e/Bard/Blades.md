#Bard
*This is a homebrew class that combines many of the features from the College of Valor and College of Swords subclasses. This is done to make a more rounded class that also no longer falls behind of modern 5e design.*

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Blades at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

If you’re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

### Fighting Style
At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your speciality. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### • Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### • Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Blade Flourish
At 3rd level, you learn to conduct impressive displays of martial prowess and speed. You learn 3 Blade Flourishes detailed on the [[dnd5e/Bard/Flourishes\|Flourishes]] page.

Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the Blade Flourish options you know. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.

You learn 2 additional Flourishes at levels 6 (5 total), 10 (7 total) and 14 (9 total).

The number of times you can use a Blade Flourish option during your turns increases to 2 when you reach 6th level in this class.

### Combat Inspiration
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Master's Flourish
Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.

Additionally, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can grant your Bardic Inspiration as a free action to an ally within 60 feet of you who can hear you.
