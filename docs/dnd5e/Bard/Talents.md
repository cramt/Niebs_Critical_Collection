#### Adventurer’s Talents
The following adventurer’s talents are listed in alphabetical order.

***Barbarian.*** You’ve learned to fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rampage as a bonus action. While rampaging and not wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You can’t concentrate on spells while rampaging. Your rampage lasts for 1 minute but ends early if you are knocked unconscious. Once you have rampaged, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

***Cleric.*** You’ve gained the ability to channel divine energy directly from the gods, emboldening your allies and sanctifying their attacks. As a bonus action, you choose a creature within 30 feet. The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your level in this class for 10 minutes. While a creature has temporary hit points granted by this spell, they can choose to lose these temporary hit points when they hit a creature with an attack, dealing additional radiant damage equal to the temporary hit points they lost. Once you use this talent, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Druid.*** You can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Polymorph\|Polymorph]] spell without expending a spell slot. If you cast the polymorph spell with this trait, you can only transform yourself into a beast with a CR less than half your level in this class. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

***Fighter.*** You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields. You also choose and learn one of the Fighting Styles available to the [[dnd5e/Fighter\|Fighter]] class.

***Monk.*** While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. In addition, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. When you use the Attack action and only make attacks with unarmed strikes on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

***Paladin.*** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d6. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.

***Ranger.*** You’ve learned the [[dnd5e/Spell/Hunters Mark\|Hunter’s Mark]] spell, which counts as a bard spell for you but does not count against your bard spells known. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot as if you had expended your highest spell slot. Once you cast the spell using this talent, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

***Rogue.*** You’ve adopted the quick thinking of clever heroes that outsmart their foes. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

***Sorcerer.*** You have 2 sorcery points and learn one of the following Metamagic options available to the sorcerer class: Careful Spell, Distant Spell, Empowered Spell, Extended Spell, Quickened Spell, or Subtle Spell. In addition, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to gain sorcery points equal to the level of the spell slot expended. When you finish a long rest, you reset to 2 sorcery points. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace the Metamagic option you know and replace it with another Metamagic option from the list.

***Warlock.*** You learn one [[dnd5e/Warlock/Invocations\|eldritch invocation]] of your choice. If an eldritch invocation has a level requirement, you use half your level in this class to determine your eligibility. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

***Wizard.*** You learn any two spells from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] that are of a level you can cast. These count as bard spells for you but do not count against your number of bard spells known. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list of a level you can cast.
