#Bard
***Bards from the College of Adventurers learn from heroes of old and stories of legend. Bards are jacks of all trades, and for the College of Adventurers, this statement rings ever true. They combine all the useful skills of their companions into one, allowing them to be versatile and supportive. While not having a direct goal, many adventurer-studying bards live to tell tales of other heroes or seek to create their own. Stories of heroic deeds, tales of cunning, magical anomalies, or godly might fuel the life-blood of these bards.***

### Talented Adventurer
Starting when you choose this bardic college at 3rd level, gain an adventurer’s talent of your choice. Your adventurer’s talent options are detailed one the [[dnd5e/Bard/Talents\|Talents]] page. You gain an additional adventurer’s talent of your choice at 6th level and again at 14th level.

### Party Planner
Also at 3rd level, while a creature has one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, it can use a bonus action on each of its turns to take the Help action.

### Well-Rounded
At 6th level, choose one skill, tool, and language. You gain proficiency in the chosen skill and with the chosen tool, and you can speak, read, and write the chosen language.

### Improvisational Talent
Starting at 14th level, when you finish a long rest, you can choose one adventurer’s talent you know and replace it with one you don’t.
