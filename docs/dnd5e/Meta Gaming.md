#MetaGaming
As defined on Wikipedia, meta-gaming can be summed up as:

*"Metagaming is a term used in role-playing games, which describes a player's use of real-life knowledge concerning the state of the game to determine their character's actions, when said character has no relevant knowledge or awareness under the circumstances."*

**That sounds nice, but what does it all mean?**

Well, nothing beats a good old example.

Let's say you're an experienced player. Maybe you've even dm'ed a few times, so you know your way around a Monster Manual or two.

You and your party are suddenly face-to-face with a big scary Troll. You're playing a Wizard and you and your party are only 3rd level.

All is going well, you keep hitting the troll and doing massive damage, and finally, the Troll falls to the ground. But before you can celebrate, the damned thing gets up again.

Now, you being an amazingly experienced player might now what's going on here. Trolls have an uncanny ability to regenerate and are therefore very hard to kill. But they do have a weakness, that being fire or acid.

This is where meta-gaming comes in. *You as the player* know what's going on here, and you know the solution. But *your character* might not understand the situation. This is an important distinction to keep in mind.

Now, we established that your party was at a pretty low level, so they have probably never seen a real Troll before. Your character might know what's going on, or they might not. This is where it gets tricky and once you've played enough, you'll start to get a sense for what makes sense and what doesn't make sense for your character to know.

The easiest thing to do is just to ask your dm. "Hey, do I know that fire is their weakness here?". Your dm might tell you to roll for it, or they might just give you a straight answer.

But the best thing for you to do is just to let your character discover the solution organically. Try blasting the Troll with ice, charming it, or something else. More often than not, these panicked and fail-filled moments are great fun for the whole party, as you fumble your way into an accidental solution to the problem.

**It's never about being the best at the game or optimizing your damage output. It's about having fun with your friends.**
