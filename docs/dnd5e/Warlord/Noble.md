#Warlord
***A Warlord with a Noble Presence is not inherently one that was born a Noble, though many are. A Noble Presence Warlord is one that serves to drive their retainers and companions onto greater heights through sheer charisma, a shining beacon of what they are fighting for standing beside them. Since time immemorial men have fought twice as hard on a battlefield when their leader takes the field to stand among them, driven to heights that would seem impossible in order to protect their liege - while an adventurer of this path may or may not be their liege, their charisma invokes the same fervor in their companions and retainers. An adventurer on this path is not inherently of noble background, though many often are. A noble reared on the laws of the land is usually lawful, but extraordinary circumstances may have brought about a rebellious streak in one that now seeks to overthrow unfit rulers (or rulers that aren't them, anyway).***

### Destined Leader
Starting at 1st level when you take this Presence you gain proficiency with rapiers, longswords and the Persuasion skill. Additionally, you gain an additional Leadership Die at 3rd level, 9th level, and 15th level.

### Call to Arms
Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative you can call out to friendly creatures within 60 feet of you, providing them with a surge of inspiration, they can add your Charisma modifier to their first attack roll made before the end of their turn.

### Inspiring Leader
Additionally at 1st level, a creature with a CR of less than half your Warlord level (or with fewer class levels than you have Warlord levels if the creature does not have a CR) can choose to use your proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier for their attack roll modifier on any Attack granted by Battlefield Presence.

### Words of Conviction
Starting at 7th level, you can use Leadership Dice to cast bless or heroism without providing material components. The level of the spell is equal to the Leadership Dice spent

### Imperative Order
Starting at 7th level, when you spend 2 or more Leadership Dice on a target with Urgent Orders, you can allow the target creature to make a single weapon attack with their reaction instead of moving. If you spend 3 or more Leadership Dice on a target, the target creature can both move and make a single weapon attack with their reaction.

### Inspired Zeal
Starting at 11th level, you are always under the effect of crusader's mantle. This effect does not require concentration, and returns at the start of your next turn if removed, dispelled, or suppressed.

### Untouchable Presence
Starting at 15th level, you are under the effect of sanctuary. This effect ends as normal if you take an action that would break it, but returns at the start of your next turn.

The spell save DC for this spell is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

### Grand Decree
Starting at 18th level, you can use this ability to cast command without expending a spell slot or Leadership Dice. When you do so, the spell affects all creatures of your choice within range that could be affected by the spell.

Once you cast command using this ability, you cannot cast it using this ability again until you complete a long rest.
