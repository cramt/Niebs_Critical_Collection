#Warlord
***Legends tell of warriors that fight at the front of a legion, of the valor they display and the inspiration it gives their comrades. A Paragon before their army is a dauntless foe, and an army behind their Paragon is an unstoppable legion. A Paragon is not inherently good or evil. An evil legion can be led by a bold and charismatic Warlord just as effectively as the forces of good. As they tend to be those that inspire an organized force, more often than not they will be lawful, but what that personal code of laws entails can vary quite widely.***

### Martial Proficiency
Starting at 1st level when you take this Presence, you gain proficiency in heavy armor, shields, and martial weapons.

### Lead the Charge
Starting at 1st level, you can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. Additionally, when you roll initiative you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### • Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### • Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### • Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

##### • Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Heroic Strike
Additionally at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action, once per turn you can expend a Leadership Dice (up to your per turn limit) to apply Rallying Mark as part of a melee weapon attack.

Whenever you expend Leadership Dice as part of making an attack, you can add the expended Leadership Dice to the damage roll of the attack.

### Stand Defiant
Starting at 7th level, when you are reduced to zero hit points, you instantly regain a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Additionally, you can roll a number of Leadership Dice equal to the number of friendly creatures within 60 feet of you, expanding them and regaining additional hit points equal to the value rolled this way. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Inspired Warrior
Starting at 11th level, once per turn, when one of your allies within 30 feet takes or deals damage, you gain d4 dice, adding it to a pool of dice. You can have a maximum number of d4 dice in this pool equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

Until the end of your next turn, when you deal damage you can expend any number of dice from this pool rolling them and dealing additional damage equal to the value rolled.

### Dauntless Resolve
Starting at 15th level, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you do this, you cannot do this again until you complete a long rest.

### Invincible Legion
Starting at 18th level, your allies will never fall so long as their symbol of hope remains. When a friendly creature within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, they can drop to 1 hit point instead so long as they can see or hear you.

Once a friendly creature benefits from this effect, they cannot benefit from it again until they complete a long rest.
