#Spellblade
***Suddenly throwing your weapon at the enemy often instantly puts them on their backfoot, leaving them open for a swift finisher. Creating and taking advantage of such windows of opportunity is the speciality of the Impalers***

### Aegis
When you take this discipline at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Thrower:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to immediately draw and throw a weapon with the thrown property as part of the same bonus action. Whether or not the attack hits, the weapon returns to your hand or somewhere on your person.

While this Aegis is active, you can use your bonus action to repeat the thrown attack. Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Arcane Throwing
At 3rd level, you specialize in thrown weaponry. When you inscribe a weapon with the thrown property using your Arcane Weapon feature, you gain the following benefits when using the weapon:
* You can draw the weapon as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
* When you hit with a ranged attack using the weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* It returns to your hand immediately after you use it to make a ranged attack.
* Ranged attacks with the weapon ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

Additionally, you can inscribe 2 extra weapons with the thrown property using your Arcane Weapon feature.

### Flurry of Blades
Starting at 7th level, you train in exploiting tiny weaknesses in your foes' defences. While you have your Aegis of the Thrower active, you gain the following benefits:
* Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
* Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
* Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, your AC increases cumulatively by +1 against the creature until the start of your next turn.

### Pinpoint Accuracy
At 15th level, your accuracy with thrown weapons has surpassed common sense. While you have your Aegis of the Thrower active, you gain the following benefits:
* As a bonus action, you can designate a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. You know where the creature is, the creature gains no benefit from total cover, and you can target it with ranged attacks using the weapon even when you cannot see them.
* Any ranged attack roll you make with the weapon is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

### Tornado of Blades
Starting at 20th level, you become one with your weapons, and the distance between you and your enemies is meaningless. As an action, you can go into a focused state for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain the following benefits:
* You can attack a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice), instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, provided you're making ranged attacks with weapons that have the thrown property.
* Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged attack using a weapon that has the thrown property, you gain a cumulative +1 to attack and damage rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn.
* You can make opportunity attacks against creatures that move within the short range of any thrown weapons you have inscribed using your Arcane Weapon feature.
* When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.
