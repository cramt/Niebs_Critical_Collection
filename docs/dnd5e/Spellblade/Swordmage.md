#Spellblade
***Spellblades that become Swordmages refrain from specializing in a type of magic, but instead prefer a more holistic approach. Their rigorous studies reward them with magical secrets unknown to other spellblades.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.
||~ Swordmage Spells |
|~ Spellblade Level |~ Spells |
| 3rd | A 1st level spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] |
| 5th | A 2nd level spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] |
| 9th | A 3rd level spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] |
| 13th | A 4th level spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] |
| 17th | A 5th level spell of your choice from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] |

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Spellcraft:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to empower nearby magic. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can add your proficiency bonus to one damage roll of that spell. If a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell that deals damage, you can use your reaction to add the same bonus to their spell.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Studious Learner
Starting at 3rd level, you have picked up useful tidbits of knowledge. You learn a cantrip from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]] and either a language or tool proficiency of your choice. The cantrip is added to your cantrips known but does not count against your number of cantrips known. If it doesn't appear on your spell list, it is nonetheless spellblade spell for you.

### Ritualist
At 7th level, you have delved deeper into esoteric studies and have learned to cast spells as rituals. You gain a ritual book, which contains the spells you can cast as a ritual as long as you have the book on hand. Your ritual book starts off with two 1st level spells and one 2nd level spell with the ritual tag from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]]. If you already have a ritual book, you can add those spells to your book.

If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical scroll or a wizard's spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]], the spell's level must be of a level you can cast, and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual books takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level of the spell. This cost represents material components spent on practicing the spell, as well as the fine inks you must use to record it.

### Spell Echo
When you reach 15th level, after casting a spell, you retain an echo of the spell's energy to empower you in combat. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can gain one of the following effects depending on the spell's school that last until the end of your next turn:

|Spell School |Spell Echo |
|---|---|
| Abjuration | Your AC and saving throws gain a bonus equal to the spell's level |
| Conjuration | The teleportation distance of Arcane Step is tripled |
| Divination | You have advantage on all attack rolls |
| Enchantment | All creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellblade DC or be frightened of you |
| Evocation | Your next weapon attack that hits deals additional force damage equal to 1d10 per spell level |
| Illusion | Your form blurs and creatures have disadvantage on attacks rolls against you |
| Necromancy | When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt |
| Transmutation | You gain an additional action each turn that can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, or Disengage action |

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Magical Thesis
At 20th level, your magical studies reach a culmination as you study powerful magic beyond your peers. You learn a 6th level spell from the [[dnd5e/Spells/Wizard\|wizard spell list]]. The spell counts as a spellblade spell for you. You can cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
