When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Hope:** As a bonus action you can activate your Aegis to begin glowing with radiant passion. For the duration of this Aegis, you shed magical bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Any creatures of your choice gain advantage on death saving throws while touched by the light created by your Aegis.

Additionally, allies within 10 feet of you become immune to the frightened condition for the duration of your Aegis. If an ally is frightened when they enter the radius of your Aegis, the effect is suspended for the duration of the Aegis. This range increase to 15 feet at 7th level, 20 feet at 15th level, and finally to 30 feet at 20th level.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you don medium- or heavy armor or a shield, fall unconscious, or die.

At 15th level, you steel your mind against outside influences. You gain immunity to the frightened condition and the charmed condition.

Additionally, allies affected by your Aegis become immune to charm effects. If an ally is charmed when they enter the radius of your Aegis, the effect is suspended for the duration of the Aegis.

You can use this ability once per long rest.
