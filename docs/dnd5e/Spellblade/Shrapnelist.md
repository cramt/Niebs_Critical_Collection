#Spellblade
***Unlike other spellblades, Shrapnelists specialize in conjuring magical weapons to overwhelm foes in battle. Shrapenlists require intense focus in order to control their conjurations and their own weapon.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Blade:** As a bonus action, you create a floating magical weapon called an Aegis Blade within 30 feet of you. When you activate this aegis, you can make a melee attack against a creature within range of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your ability modifier. The ability modifier you use for your Aegis Blade is the same modifier you use for your Arcane Weapon. As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move your Aegis Blade up to 30 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within range of it.

Your Aegis Blade lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

The damage from your Aegis Blade increases to 2d8 at 15th level.

### Conjure Steel
At 3rd level, you can conjure weapons out of magical energy using your knowledge of craftsmanship. You gain proficiency in smith's tools.

You can also perform a ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, to create any simple or martial weapon. The weapon you create cannot be magical.

You can have a number of created weapons up to your proficiency bonus. If you are at your maximum limit of created weapons, and you attempt to create a new weapon, then you must destroy one of your previously created weapons.

### Blade Parry
Starting at 7th level, you can use your weapon or your summoned blade to block attacks. When you see another creature hit with a melee attack and you or your Aegis Blade are within melee range of the creature, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the attacked target's AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

### Sword Dash
When you reach 15th level, you can dimensionally follow your summoned blade. After you use your bonus action to command your Aegis Blade, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to your Aegis Blade as part of the same bonus action. The teleportation fails if your Aegis Blade is more than 60 feet away from you.

### Dance of Steel
At 20th level, as a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you can summon magical weapons that dance around you in a 15-foot aura that lasts for 1 minute. Any creature of your choice that enters the aura for the first time or starts their turn in your aura takes 4d8 slashing damage. Any creature within the aura has half cover to creatures outside of the aura, and the aura's space is difficult terrain to any creature but you.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest.
