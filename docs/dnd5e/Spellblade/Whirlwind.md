#Spellblade
***Some Spellblades are at their best when surrounded on all sides. Going against all logic, their strength increases as the odds continue to stack against them.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Horde Breaker:** As a bonus action you can activate this Aegis to enter a tempoary focused state. For the duration of this Aegis, you gain the following benefits:

* Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 10 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

* Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.

* When a creature hits you with an attack, your AC increases cumulatively by +2 until the beginning of your next turn.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious, or die.

### Center of Attention
At 3rd level, you master new crowd-control techniques. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

Additionally, if your GM uses the optional flanking rules, you are immune to the effects of flanking.

### Stampede Stomper
Beginning at 7th level, none can escape your grasp once they entered it. If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you and you've already taken your reaction, you can choose to make the attack without spending a reaction.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all unspent uses upon finishing a long rest.

### Morale Sweep
At 15th level, your ability to fight while surrounded is second to none. You can use your action to make melee attacks against any number of creatures within 10 feet of you and within reach of your weapon, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you hit a creature with an attack using this feature, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Tideeater
At 20th level, your focus on culling hordes has reached its zenith. Once per turn, if you reduce a creature to zero hit points, you may immediately take an additional action.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all unspent uses upon finishing a long rest.
