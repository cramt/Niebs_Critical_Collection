#Spellblade
***Spellblades that become Meteor Knights study the esoteric magic of dunamancy, specifically concerning the manipulation of gravity. Fascinated by celestial bodies, these spellblades channel the powers of the stars to keep foes in their orbit of destruction.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Gravity:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to infuse yourself with the strength of the stars. For the duration of this Aegis, you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

Additionally, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see moves, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature's speed drops to 0 until the start of their next turn. This stops any movement they may have been taking.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Student of the Stars
At 3rd level you manipulate your density to withstand more weight than normal. You gain proficiency with heavy armor and cartographer's tools. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

### Star Fall
Starting at 7th level, you can teleport towards an area in a fiery explosion reminiscent of a meteor. When you use your Arcane Step feature, you can double the teleportation distance and each creature within 10 feet of the space you teleport to must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 fire damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Starting at 15th level, the damage increases to 4d8.

### Controlled Descent
At 15th level, you utilize your mastery of dunamancy to escape dangers that would threaten others. When you fall, you take no falling damage and can always land on your feet.

Additionally, when you fall from a height of more than 10 feet, and have a use of your Star Fall feature, you can use Star Fall, except you rapidly fall instead of teleporting. At the end of the fall, the fiery explosion of Star Fall emanates from the space you land in.

### Gravitational Pull
Beginning at 20th level, as a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you create heavy gravitational pull in a 30 feet aura centered on you for 1 minute. The area inside the aura is difficult terrain for any creatures of your choice. Any creature of your choosing that starts their turn inside the aura must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is pulled to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't pulled.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
