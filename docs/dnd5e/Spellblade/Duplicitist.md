#Spellblade
***By choosing the Duplicitist archetype, you weave illusions and enchantments to become an elusive threat. Duplicitist spellblades are often deadly assassins, admirers of the fey, cunning warriors, or mischief-makers.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.
||~ Duplicitist Spells |
|~ Spellblade Level |~ Spells |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Disguise Self\|Disguise Self]] |
| 5th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Invisibility\|Invisibility]] |
| 9th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Enemies Abound\|Enemies Abound]] |
| 13th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Greater Invisibility\|Greater Invisibility]] |
| 17th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Mislead\|Mislead]] |

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Deception:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to become invisible until the end of your turn. For the duration of this Aegis, you can use your bonus action to gain the same benefit. The invisibility granted from your Aegis always ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Cunning Trickery
At 3rd level, you are a master at trickery. You know the [[dnd5e/Spell/Minor Illusion\|Minor Illusion]] cantrip and gain proficiency in either the Deception or Stealth skill.

### Beguiling Magic
When you reach 7th level, your slippery magic makes your subterfuge and spells difficult to resist. When you make an ability check using the proficiency you gained from your Cunning Trickery feature, your proficiency bonus is doubled. The skill must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.

When a creature makes a saving throw against one of your spells, you can impose disadvantage on the saving throw as a reaction. Once you use this reaction, you can't use it again until after a short or long rest.

### Illusive Escape
Starting at 15th level, when you teleport, you leave behind a mirror image of yourself to distract foes. When you teleport from a spell or your Arcane Step feature, you immediately turn invisible. You also leave behind an illusionary image of you that shares your AC and saving throws. A creature that uses an action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spellblade spell save DC.

The image and your invisibility last until the start of your next turn. Your invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell, and the image ends early if damaged.

### Double Trouble
At 20th level, you weave shadows together to create a near copy of yourself. You can use your action to create a shadowy duplicate of yourself as if you had cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Simulacrum\|Simulacrum]] spell.

The duplicate's AC equals your own AC. It has a shadowy weapon that matches the statistics of one of your Arcane Weapons.

The duplicate cannot use Double Trouble on itself.

The shadowy duplicate fades away after 1 minute or if it is reduced to 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest.
