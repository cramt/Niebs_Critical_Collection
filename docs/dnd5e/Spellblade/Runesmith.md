#Spellblade
***All the runes that Spellblades utilize are inspired by the runic magic used by the mighty giants. It is the work of the Runesmiths to research and develop these runes, so that they may be utilized by mere mortals. They utilize their greater understanding of runic magic to enhance their gear and the world around them.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.
||~ Runesmith Spells |

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Giant:** As a bonus action, you increase in size as per the [[dnd5e/Spell/Enlarge Reduce\|Enlarge/Reduce]] spell, requiring no concentration, for the duration.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Runic Casting
At 3rd level, you discover more efficient ways of casting certain magic. You learn two 1st level spells with the ritual tag from [[dnd5e/Spells\|any spell list]]. These two spells do not count against your number of spells known.

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a spellblade spell that you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Runic Enhancement
At 7th level, you pick up new ways of enhancing your gear. You learn two infusions from the [[dnd5e/Artificer/Infusions\|list of artificer infusions]]. You must still meet the level prerequisites for your chosen infusions. You can then, over the course of a long rest, infuse these 2 infusions into appropriate objects.

Weapons inscribed using your Arcane Weapon feature can be infused, even though they're considered magical.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the infusions you know with a new one from the [[dnd5e/Artificer/Infusions\|list of artificer infusions]]. You must still meet the level prerequisite for the new infusion.

### Runic Prototyping
Also at 7th level, you can inscribe an additional weapon using your Arcane Weapon feature. Additionally, your Arcane Weapons can now be attuned to by any creatures of your choice. When another creature attunes to one of your Arcane Weapons, the attunement takes up an attunement slot as normal.

You can inscribe an additional weapon at 15th level (4 total) and again at 20th level (5 total)

### Body Canvas
At 15th level, you start dabbling with infusion your own body with runic magic. While you are concentration on a spell, you can add 1d6 to any saving throw that you make.

### Rune herald
At 20th level, you have now become a master of Runes, only over-shadowed by the very giants that inspired you. As an action, you can activate the runes that now cover your body for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to all damage.

* Your attacks ignore all resistances.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.
