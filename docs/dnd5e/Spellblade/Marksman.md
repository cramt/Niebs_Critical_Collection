#Spellblade
***Alongside arcane advancements run technological advancements. These two paths sometimes cross, to deathly effect. Spellblade Marksmen utilize firearms and enhance them with their arcane arts, raining death from afar.***

### Aegis
When you take this discipline at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Gunslinger:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to reload a firearm and magically enhance your shooting. For the duration, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls and your ranged weapons ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. While this Aegis is active, you can use your bonus action to reload a firearm.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Firearm Proficiency
Upon picking this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms and Tinker's Tools.

### Swift Fingers
At 3rd level, you are unnervingly gifted in reloading firearms. You can reload a firearm without requiring a free hand.

You also gain proficiency in your choice of either the Perception or Stealth skill.

Lastly, you can also stow a firearm, then draw another firearm as a single object interaction on your turn.

### Spellshot
When you reach 7th level, you can infuse your shots with arcane energy. As an action, you can infuse a firearm with a spellblade cantrip you know.

The spell must have a casting time of 1 action.

As a part of the same action, make a firearm attack.

If the attack hits, the target takes the normal damage of the attack and the spell is cast on them, either as the sole target or as the center of the effect, regardless of the spell's range. If the spell requires you to make a weapon attack as part of casting it, this attack counts as performing the attack.

If the attack misses, the spell is wasted.

Starting at 15th level, you may infuse 1st-level or higher spells using the same method, consuming the appropriate spellslot.

### Arcane Duelist
By 15th level, you've learned to see the signs of when a fight is about to break out and how to act accordingly. You can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

### Neverending Barrage
At 20th level, you learn to magically create the ammunition required to slay your foes. While your Aegis of the Gunslinger is active, you ignore the loading properties of firearms as magical ammunition is created inside your weapons as you fire. Additionally, you have advantage on the first ranged attack roll you make each turn for the duration of your Aegis.
