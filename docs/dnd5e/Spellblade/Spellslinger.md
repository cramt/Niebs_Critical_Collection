***Spellslingers are highly proficient in casting minor magics and dishing out constant damage. What they might lack in raw power, they make up for in pure tenacity.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Spellswarm:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to empower your spellcasting. When you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action.

Additionally, you gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) for the duration.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Arcane Slingshot
Starting from 3rd level, you gain additional innate spells at your fingertips. Choose three cantrips from [[dnd5e/Spells\|any spell list]] (they needn't be from the same spell list). These cantrips are added to your cantrips known but do not count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on your spell list, they are nonetheless spellblade spells for you.

Additionally, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage of your cantrips.

### Close Quarters Caster
Starting at 7th level, you train in the art of casting spells while in the middle of the fray. When making a ranged spell attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Innate Magics
At 15th level, some magic becomes second nature for you. Choose a 1st-level spellblade spell that you know. You can cast this spell at it's lowest level without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast the spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange the spell you chose for different a spell of the same level.

### Overcast
At 20th level, you gain the ability to channel arcane energies beyond mortal limits. While your Aegis of the Spellswarm is active, you gain the following benefits:

* When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you may cast an additional cantrip with a casting time of 1 action, as part of the same action.

* When you use your action to cast a spell of any level, you can cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action.

* You gain a flying speed of 60 feet and you can hover.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before being able to do so again.
