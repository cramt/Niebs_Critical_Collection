#Spellblade
***Some Spellblades prefer speed rather than power, and some take it to the extreme. These Spellblades are known as Skirmishers. Not many know about them, for the battles they are in are swift, and few live to tell the tale.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Speed:** As a bonus action while wearing light armour and not wielding a shield, you can activate this Aegis to speed up your metabolism and alter your perception of time. You can immediately take the Dash or Disengage action as part of the bonus action to activate this Aegis. For the duration of this Aegis, you gain the following benefits:

* Your speed is increased by 10 feet.

* You can use your bonus action to Dash or Disengage.

* Opportunity attacks made against you are made with disadvantage.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you don medium- or heavy armor or a shield, fall unconscious, or die.

### Slipstream
At 3rd level, you are unnaturally speedy. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.

Additionally, you learn the [[dnd5e/Spell/Longstrider\|Longstrider]] spell and you can cast it on yourself without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

### Evasive Speed
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

Additionally, while your Aegis of Speed is active, you gain the following additional benefits:

* You gain a climb and swim speed equal to your walking speed.

* You ignore non-magical difficult terrain.

### Superseeded Speed
At 15th level, your gift of speed increases. Your Aegis of Speed can now be used while wearing medium armor.

Additionally, while your Aegis of Speed is active, you gain the following additional benefits:

* Whenever you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can attack twice, instead of once, with your bonus action. You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

* If a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to make a weapon attack against that creature.

### Focused Speed
At 20th level, your focus on martial prowess reaches its pinnacle. As an action, you can make a single precise attack with an Arcane Weapon against a creature within melee range. This attack automatically hits the creature. Regardless, make an attack roll against the creature. This attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 16 to 20 on the d20. Additionally, if the target has fewer than 100 hit points when you score a critical hit with this attack, you immediately kill it.

You can use this ability once per long rest.
