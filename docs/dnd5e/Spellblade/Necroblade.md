#Spellblade
***Some Spellblades refuse to accept that their power is limited to the elements taught to them by their order. Those known as Necroblades have twisted and perverted the runes available to them in order to gain access to sinister powers. Skilled Necroblades are able to sap the very life force from their opponents for their own personal gain.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Terror:** As a bonus action you can activate this Aegis to terrify your foes with dark magic. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to frighten the creature. The hit creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can only successfully frighten any creature in this way once per turn. Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Cursed Strikes
Starting from 3rd level, you may choose necrotic as the damage type for your Arcane Weapon feature.

### Life Sense
At 3rd level, you can feel the flowing blood of nearby beings. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect living creatures. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You also know if a sensed creature is below its hit point maximum, or if the creature is diseased or poisoned. This feature does not work on undead or constructs.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Bound by Death
At 7th level, you discover more forbidden runes and add them to your weaponry. If you reduce a humanoid creature to 0 hit points while your Aegis is active, you can choose to raise them as a zombie or skeleton (your choice) under your control as a reaction.

While under your control, you can command the undead as per the [[dnd5e/Spell/Animate Dead\|Animate Dead]] spell. The undead acts at the end of your turn.

You can control a number of undead created this way up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and the control lasts until you fall unconscious or begin a long rest, whereupon the undead crumbles into dust.

### Positively Negative
Starting from 15th level, your hit point maximum cannot be reduced by any means, and you gain immunity to necrotic damage and the frightened condition.

Additionally, undead creatures created using your Bound by Death feature remain under your control indefinitely or until you die, whereupon they crumble to dust.

### Essence Drinker
When you reach 15th level, you unleash a burst of negative energy to steal the vitality of nearby foes. As an action, choose any number of creatures within 20 feet of you. A chosen creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If a creature is frightened of you, then they have disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failure, and half as much on a success. You regain hit points equal to half the damage taken by the creature.

This feature does not work on undead or constructs. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Soul Eater
At 20th level, the dark energies around your blade can become so potent that they can rip a soul from a target creature. As an action, you make a melee weapon attack against a humanoid creature within melee range. If the attack hits, you deal the weapons normal damage and an additional 6d10 necrotic damage to the creature.

If the creature survives, it's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

If this attack kills the creature, you can absorb the creature's soul, permanently increasing your maximum hit points by 1d4. Undead creatures and Constructs are immune to this effect.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
