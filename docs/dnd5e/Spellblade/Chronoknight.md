#Spellblade
***Some spellblades seek to master the dangerous magic of chronurgy-the manipulation of time. Fascinated by past events or altering the future, Chronoknights channel time magic to aid them in battle.***

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of Time:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to speed up time around yourself. You can immediately take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action as part of the bonus action to activate this Aegis. For the duration of this Aegis, you can use your bonus action to gain the same benefit.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Time Keeper
At 3rd level, by studying chronurgy, you have a knack for historical facts. You always know how the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset. You gain proficiency in the History skill.

You can subtly manipulate time to improve your fortunes. You know the [[dnd5e/Spell/Guidance\|Guidance]] cantrip. It does not count against your number of cantrips known.

### Timeline Insight
Starting at 7th level, you can briefly peer into other timelines. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can gain one skill, weapon, language, or tool proficiency of your choice, as you temporarily gain the talents of a version of you in a different timeline. This proficiency lasts until you use this feature again.

Additionally, when you see a creature within 30 feet of you fail an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to find a timeline where the creature succeeds. The chosen creature can reroll, and use the better result. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a short or long rest.

### Temporal Stasis
When you reach 15th level, you can lock a creature in a moment of time. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. If the creature is willing, then they are locked in time. While locked in time, the target's speed is reduced to 0, and the target can't take any actions, be affected by any other effect, and is immune to all damage. The time lock lasts for 1 minute or until you end the effect on your turn (no action required).

An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellblade spell save DC. On a success, the creature isn't affected by this feature. At the end of each turn of an unwilling, affected target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the time lock ends on the target.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a short or long rest.

### Time Beacon
At 20th level, as a bonus action, you can create a beacon in time, intending to return to it if things go wrong. Keep careful track of everything that happens in this turn. At the end of your turn, you can choose to rewind time back to just after you used Time Beacon, undoing any harmful effects that happened to you during that turn including any damage you took and teleporting you to the space you occupied when the beacons was placed. You also regain any expended resources spent during that turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest.
