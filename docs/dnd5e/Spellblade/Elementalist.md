#Spellblade
***Elementalist are spellblades that specialize in magic originating from the elemental planes. By binding the primal power of the planes to themselves, these spellblades become mortal embodiments of the elements. They might show minor physical manifestations of this power such as earthen skin, an ozone smell, or damp hair.***

### Elemental Attunement
Choose one of the four great elemental planes: air, earth, fire, or water. This element becomes your Elemental Attunement. For each Elemental Attunement, you gain an associated damage type, learn a cantrip, and gain aegis spells as seen on the Elemental Attunement Table.

You can change your Elemental Attunement whenever you gain a level in this class. When you change your Elemental Attunement, you replace the benefits gained from your previous attunement to the benefits gained by your new attunement.
