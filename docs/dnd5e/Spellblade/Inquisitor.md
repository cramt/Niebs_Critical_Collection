### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Hunter:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis and then mark a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. The first time each turn that you hit the marked target with a melee weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 force damage. You can only deal this damage once per turn.

If your marked target uses a spell or magical effect against you that forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give yourself advantage on the saving throw.

As a bonus action, you can change marked target to another creature within 60 feet of you that you can see.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Eyes of the Inquisitor
At 3rd level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] spell without expending a spell slot.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Investigator's Insight
Beginning at 7th level, you have an uncanny intuition after investigating the hidden and obscure. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your proficiency bonus.

Your experience with hostile magic causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.

### Spell Catcher
Starting at 15th level, you redirect harmful magic to invigorate yourself. You gain resistance to damage from spells.

When you use your reaction from Aegis of the Hunter and succeed on the saving throw, you siphon off some of the magic. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

### Antimagic Zone
At 20th level, as a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you can create a 10-foot radius zone of antimagic, as per the [[dnd5e/Spell/Antimagic Field\|Antimagic Field]] spell, within 30 feet of you that lasts for 1 minute. You can move the antimagic zone 30 feet as a bonus action on your turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until after a long rest.
