#Spellblade
***Some Spellblades prefer a more personal touch when dealing with their foes. Getting up close and dishing out beat-downs is the forte of the Runefists. Their bodies become living weapons, infused with their runic magics and capable of superhuman feats.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.
||~ Runefist Spells |
|~ Spellblade Level |~ Spells |

### Aegis
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Fist:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis and increase the reach of your unarmed strikes by 10 feet.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Rune Hands
At 3rd level, you've trained in hand-to-hand combat. Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

Additionally, you can inscribe both of your fists with your Arcane Weapon feature. They only count as one of your maximum inscribed weapons when inscribed in this manner.

### Rune Body
Also starting at 3rd level, you inscribe defensive runes on your body. You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Mage Armor\|Mage Armor]] on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Swift Runes
Starting at 7th level, your strikes become as swift as they are deadly. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or an inscribed weapon or cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

Additionally, you develop enhancing runes and apply them to your body. You gain the following passive benefits:

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
***Siege.*** All melee attacks using utilizing Runeblades deal double damage against objects and structures.

### Active defence
Beginning at 15th level, you improve on the defensive runes inscribed on your body. While your Aegis of the Fist is active, when you are hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Batteries
Starting at 20th level, you discover methods of storing spells within the runes that cover your fists. Your fists can each store Spells cast into them, holding them until you use them. Each fist can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time.

You can cast a spell of 1st through 5th Level into one of your fists by touching the fist as the spell is cast. The spell has no Effect, other than to be stored in the fist. If the fist can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without Effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

You can cast any spell stored in it as part of making an unarmed strike. You can cast the spell after rolling the attack, but before you know if the attack hits. When a spell stored is cast this way, it counts as having been cast before the attack, thereby granting any of the spells benefits to the attack. The spell cast is then no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
