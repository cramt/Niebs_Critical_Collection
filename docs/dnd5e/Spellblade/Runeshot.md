#Spellblade
***A few, rare Spellblades forgo close-quarter combat to instead focus on engaging their enemies from afar. Runeshots prefer to channel their battle magic through bows, crossbows, or anything that can be thrown.***

### Discipline Spells
You gain discipline spells at the Spellblade levels listed.

### Aegis
When you take this discipline at 3rd level, you gain the following Aegis option:
**Aegis of the Sniper:** As a bonus action, you can activate this Aegis to magically enhance your aim, and you gain advantage on your next ranged attack roll before the end of your turn. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 force damage. While this Aegis is active, you can use your bonus action to gain the same benefit.

Your Aegis lasts for 1 minute, ending early if you fall unconscious or die.

### Eldritch Readiness
At 3rd level, you are never left empty-handed in battle. If your Arcane Weapon requires ammunition and you are out of ammunition, then mundane ammunition is magically created as needed. If your Arcane Weapon has the Thrown property, then it magically returns to your hand after you throw it.

You also gain proficiency in woodcarver tools and your choice of the Perception or Stealth skill.

### Elemental Projectile
When you reach 7th level, you can enchant your weapon with deadly elemental magic. When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can inflict elemental magic against the creature. You can choose from one of the following effects:
* **Acidic Projectile:** The creature takes 2d8 acid damage and acid hinders their vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

* **Explosive Projectile:** The arrow explodes in flames at it hits the creature. The target and all other creatures within 20 feet of the target each take 2d8 fire damage.

* **Frost Projectile:** The creature takes 2d8 cold damage and frost begins to freeze their body. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained until the end of your next turn.

* **Storm Projectile:** Your arrow streaks like a bolt of lightning before emitting a loud cracking of thunder. The creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and is knocked prone.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Starting at 15th level, the damage increases to 4d8 for each arrow.

### Revealing Shot
Starting at 15th level, as a bonus action or as part of your bonus action to activate your Aegis, you can rapidly fire a bright beacon to an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you to illuminate enemies. Each object within a 20-foot radius of the space is outlined in light. Any creature of your choice within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spellblade spell save DC or also be outlined in light. For 1 minute, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible. If you hit an affected creature while you are under the effects of your Aegis, then the bonus damage from your Aegis increases to 2d6.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Death Arrow
At 20th level, when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can infuse the attack with deadly necromancy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target takes 8d10 necrotic damage and half as much on a success. Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, the target dies.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
