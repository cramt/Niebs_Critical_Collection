#PlayingTheGame
**Character, roleplaying, and most importantly: fun, is front and centre when playing, so please keep that in mind.**

* **Everything that you know, your character might not know.** If you're unsure of what your character might know, ask the dm. They may ask you to roll, or just tell you the information.

* **Be polite.** If you disagree with the dm, just say so.

* **Do your best to act out your character.** This is a role-playing game after all

* **Try to keep [[dnd5e/Meta Gaming\|META-gaming]] to a minimum.**

* **Always add flavour!** How do you produce spells? Do they come from within, do your spells come from runes on your staff, or is it something else, perhaps more traditional?

* **Describe what you're doing.** How do you hit your target and where do you aim?

* **Always remember to have fun** and let the other's at the table have fun as well.

* **Keep in mind: the dm is only here to let you have fun.** The dm is not out to get you, even if it might feel that way sometimes.

* **Keep the other player in mind.** Let others shine, let people have their moments. There is no need for you to constantly tell jokes or be the centre of attention.

* **Know your character.** The dm has a lot to keep track of, so learn how your class and race works. But never be afraid to ask if you're unsure.

* **Be in the moment.** We're all here to have fun, so try your best to follow along. Don't have your phone out at the table and don't browse Reddit on your computer. You have plenty of time outside the game to do that, and it's disrespectful to everyone around the table, especially the dm.

* **Voice your concerns.** If you experienced something you didn't like, just say so. But try to do this during breaks or after the session has finished, as to not break to flow of the game and make everything awkward for everyone.
