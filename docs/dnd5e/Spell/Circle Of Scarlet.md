#Spell
*4th-level evocation (Sangromancy)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of parchment with a circle drawn in humanoid blood)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of casting this spell, you must expend four hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, choose a point on the ground within range and roll the expended hit dice. A crimson pillar erupts from the ground in a 15-foot radius and 100-foot high cylinder centered on the point you chose. Each creature within the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to the total of the expended hit dice. On a failure, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to the total of the expended hit dice and must expend and roll four hit dice of its own, taking additional necrotic damage equal to the result.

For each creature who fails the saving throw against this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit points.
