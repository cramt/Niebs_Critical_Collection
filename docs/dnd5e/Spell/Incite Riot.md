#Spell
*5th-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 ft.
**Components:** V, S, M (a red handkerchief)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, you wave the red handkerchief used as the material component and choose any number of creatures within range that can see you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your allies do anything harmful to it. While charmed in this way, it must use its turn to make unarmed strikes against the nearest creature (other than you) or use its turn moving to the nearest target.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
