#Spell
*5th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** : S, M (an item of personal sentimental value worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

When you cast this spell, you drop to 0 hit points and die. At the start of your next turn, you become a ghost occupying the same space as your corpse. You use the ghost’s game statistics, retaining your alignment and personality.

While you are a ghost, you can only use abilities detailed in the ghost’s game statistics. In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to your attack rolls and the DC of saving throws your ghost abilities force others to make.

Your DM secretly rolls 1d8 at the time of casting. After a number of hours have passed equal to the result, the spell ends. The spell ends early if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a ghost or you use an action to do so. If the material component used to cast this spell remains on your corpse, you return to life with current hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. If the material component used to cast this spell is no longer on your corpse, you must make death saving throws as normal.

If your body is destroyed or damaged beyond the capacity to survive while you are under the effects of this spell, its duration becomes indefinite and you remain a ghost until you are reduced to 0 hit points, destroyed by any other effect, or your body is targeted by an effect that returns the living to the dead such as raise dead or resurrection.
