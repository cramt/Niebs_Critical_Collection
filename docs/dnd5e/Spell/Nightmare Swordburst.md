A wave of terrifying visions burst from your blade as your foes see you as their worst nightmare. Each creature you choose within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 psychic damage and is frightened of you for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened.

At the end of each of its turns, a frightened creature repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
