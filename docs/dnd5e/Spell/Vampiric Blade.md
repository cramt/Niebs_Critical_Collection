#Spell
*Necromancy cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and you sap their life force. You gain 1d4 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points disappear at the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target on a hit. The damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and again at 17th level (3d8). Additionally, the temporary hit points gained increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.
