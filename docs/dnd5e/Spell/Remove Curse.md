#Spell
*Note that this spell has been slightly reworked, to make it possible to have more interesting curses.*

*3rd-level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all minor curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its ownerâ€™s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

Attempting to remove more difficult curses will require a successful spell check, set by the dm.
