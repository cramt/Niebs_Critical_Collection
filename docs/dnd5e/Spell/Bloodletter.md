#Spell
*2nd-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, the next creature hit by the weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive a festering wound. A creature with a festering wound takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the beginning of its turn for the remainder of the spellâ€™s duration. A creature can only have one festering wound at a time.

Receiving at least 1 point of magical healing closes a festering wound, ending the recurring damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the damage dealt by a festering wound by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
