#Spell
*4th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you attack you or a friendly creature
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You interrupt a creature's attack by warping space with your blade, causing your foe to appear a short distance away and unleash its attack elsewhere. The creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from their original location. That space must be on the ground or on a floor. The creature then makes their attack against another creature of your choosing within the creature's range. If there is no creature within range, the attack is expended.
