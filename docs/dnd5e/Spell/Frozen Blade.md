You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn. Creatures that have resistance or immunity to cold damage are immune to the slowing effect of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target on a hit. The damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and 17th level (3d8).
