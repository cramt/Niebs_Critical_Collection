#Spell
*7th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of quicksilver worth 500 gp and a life-sized human doll, both of which the spell consumes, and an intricate crystal rod worth at least 1,500 gp that is not consumed)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

While casting the spell, you place a vial of quicksilver in the chest of a life-sized human doll stuffed with ash or dust. You then stitch up the doll and drip your blood on it. At the end of the casting, you tap the doll with a crystal rod, transforming it into a *Magen* clothed in whatever the doll was wearing. The type of Magen is chosen by you during the casting of the spell. See below for different kinds of Magen and their statistics.

When the Magen appears, your hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Magen's challenge rating (minimum reduction of 1). Only a wish spell can undo this reduction to your hit point maximum.

Any magen you create with this spell obeys your commands without question.

###### ***Magens***
*Magen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell or by other arcane methods.*

*Though Magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.*

***Magical Servants.*** Magen make ideal servants. At creation, each is instilled with an instinct to protect itself and its creator, and it follows its creator's instructions without hesitation. When its task is complete, a Magen stands immobile and silent until its creator gives it new orders.
