#Spell
*3rd-level pure sangromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of molasses, the brains of a bat)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a small shard out of blood and fling it at once creature within range that you can see. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage and has disadvantage on its first saving throw against this effect. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 necrotic damage and be diseased for 1 minute. A creature is immune to this effect if it does not have blood. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not diseased.

When a diseased creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it erupts in a bloody fountain. Each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 necrotic damage and be diseased for 1 minute.

***At Higher Levels.*** . When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the necrotic damage of the explosions is increased by 1d8 each.
