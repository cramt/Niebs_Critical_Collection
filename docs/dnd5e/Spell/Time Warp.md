You warp time to speed yourself up and catch glimpses of other timelines to become aware of all possibilities. For the spell's duration, you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you for the duration.

When the spell ends, your body is staggered as the various timelines resynchronize, and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of your next turn.
