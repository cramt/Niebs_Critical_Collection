#Spell
*4th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You slam your weapon into the ground and seismic energy erupts from you. Each creature you choose within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
