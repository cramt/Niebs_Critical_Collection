#Spell
*1st-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, you slow down time around them, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for its duration.

The affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions.

On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

The target affected by this spell can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
