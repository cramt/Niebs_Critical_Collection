#Spell
*2nd-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Empowering your blade with crackling electricity, you hold your weapon aloft as lightning strikes out at your surrounding foes. Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 lightning damage and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and can take reactions. The creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if they are wearing armor made of metal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
