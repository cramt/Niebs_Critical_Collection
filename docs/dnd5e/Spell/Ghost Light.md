#Spell
*1st-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a clear marble)
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension and specify any number of creatures you can see within 10 feet. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright silvery light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This light is only visible to the creatures you specified during the initial casting of the spell; all other creatures perceive the area affected by the ghost lantern as they regularly would.
