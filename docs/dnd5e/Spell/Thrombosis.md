*1st-level pure sangromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a horned lizard's liver)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Dark violet energies erupt from your hand to a creature within range that you can see which begins to tense up. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 necrotic damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spellâ€™s range or if it has total cover from you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
