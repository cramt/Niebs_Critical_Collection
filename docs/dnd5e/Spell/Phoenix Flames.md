#Spell
*9th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You immolate yourself, consuming your body in a searing cloud of holy flames. All creatures within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 30d6 radiant damage and gain one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not exhausted. If a target is killed by this damage, its body is incinerated.

After 10 minutes, you rise from the ashes where you originally cast the spell. You are returned fully to life as if you were affected by a true resurrection spell
