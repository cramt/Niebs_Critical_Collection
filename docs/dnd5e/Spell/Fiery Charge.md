#Spell
*4th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl your blade and it transforms into a line of roaring fire 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a creature within range. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied square within 5 feet of the target. The roaring flames transform back into your weapon and returns to your hand. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the target. On a hit, you deal an extra 4d8 fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage for both rolls increases by 1d8 for each slot above 4th.
