Raging fire bursts from your blade and engulfs your foes in an inferno. Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage and begins burning. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and doesn't burn. While a target is burning, it takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of its turn. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the burning ends on the target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
