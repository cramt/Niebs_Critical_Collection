#Spell
*Illusion cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 5 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create an illusionary copy of a mundane musical instrument. The copy of the instrument takes on the shape of your fondest memory of the instrument, such as the first flute you owned, or the half harp gifted to you by a loved one. This illusion moves as its physical counterpart would, but it is weightless and is tangible only to the caster of the spell. This instrument may be used as a spellcasting focus. This illusory instrument dissipates if the spellcaster moves 10 feet away from it or chooses to end the spell.

As a bonus action, you can command your instrument to create one of the following effects:
* Mimic basic sounds heard on a daily basis, such as a bird chirping, footsteps, or a slamming door.
* Automatically play a basic beat at the tempo of your choice.
* Record anything played on it, and play it back on a loop.
* Record and play back any noise that it could pick up within 15 feet, such as conversation, a royal decree, or a snoring party member who swears that they donâ€™t.
