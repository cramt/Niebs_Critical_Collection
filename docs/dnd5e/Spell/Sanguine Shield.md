#Spell
*2nd-level abjuration (Sangromancy)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As part of casting this spell, you must expend two hit dice or the spell automatically fails. You draw lifeforce from those injured around you to create a swirling shield of blood. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature within a 30 feet radius that is below its hit point maximum (including you) to a maximum of 15.

While you have these hit points, you are considered to be behind half cover for any ranged attack made against you. When this spell ends, all remaining temporary hit points provided by it are lost.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum number of temporary hit points you can gain from casting it increases by 5 for each two slot levels above 2nd.
