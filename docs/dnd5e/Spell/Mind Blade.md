#Spell
*Enchantment cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and psychic energy assaults their mind. The creature subtracts a d4 from their next ability check until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target on a hit. The damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and again at 17th level (3d8).
