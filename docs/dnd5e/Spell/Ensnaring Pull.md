#Spell
*1st-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You pull a distant foe through dimensional space to be struck by your blade. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw.

In a failure, you teleport the creature to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, and you can make one melee weapon attack against it. The spell fails if there is no unoccupied space adjacent to you or if you teleport the creature to a space not on the ground or not on a floor.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range of the spell increases by 15 feet.
