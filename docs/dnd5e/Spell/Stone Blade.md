#Spell
*Abjuration cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and you are covered in stony armor. You gain a 1d4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. If you are attacked before then, the spell ends after the attack is made, and the stony armor crumbles.

***At Higher Levels.*** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the target on a hit. The damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and again at 17th level (3d8).
