You target a creature within range, which erupt in tiny lesions. Constructs and undead, as well as creatures without blood are immune to this effect. The target instantly takes 1d4 point of piercing damage. Additionally, whenever the creature takes damage, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or also take 1d6 additional piercing damage. On a successful save a creature takes no additional damage.

Once a creature succeeds on three saving throws, the effect ends for it. The effect also ends if you cast this spell again before its duration has expired.
