#Spell
*5th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before this spell ends, you energize your blade with crackling electricity, and the attack deals an extra 5d10 lightning damage. Additionally, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned for the spell's duration.

At the end of each of its turns, a stunned target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target.
