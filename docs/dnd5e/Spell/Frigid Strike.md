#Spell
*3rd-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon chills with elemental frost, and the attack deals an extra 3d8 cold damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the spell ends.

A creature restrained by the frost can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself and the spell ends.
