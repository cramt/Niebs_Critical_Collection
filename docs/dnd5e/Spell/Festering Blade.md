#Spell
*4th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon darkens with necrotic power, and the attack deals an extra 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wounded for the spell's duration. While wounded, hit points lost to this spell can be regained only through a Short or Long Rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one.
