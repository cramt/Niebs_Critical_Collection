*Transmutation cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 minute

You gain the ability to magically levitate a number of items, that aren't being worn or carried, equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. The objects begin to glow faintly with magical energy and the spell lasts for the duration, or until you dismiss it as an action.

You can use your action to move any of the objects up to 30 feet, but if any object moves more than 30 feet away from you, the object is no longer affected by the spell.

During the spell's duration, you can continually remove and/or add objects you affect, as long as you do not exceed your maximum count.

You cannot use the spell to attack or activate magic items.

The total weight of the objects cannot exceed 10 pounds.
