#Spell
*1st-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You detach your hand at the wrist, transforming it into a spider. While the spider is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through its eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

If the spider is killed or prevented from returning to you, your hand is restored, but you take 1d6 points of psychic damage. If you command the spider to return, it crawls back to your wrist, and the spell ends.
