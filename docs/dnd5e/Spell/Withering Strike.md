#Spell
*3rd-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon crackles with life draining energy, and the attack deals an extra 3d8 necrotic damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
