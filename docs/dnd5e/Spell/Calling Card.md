*Illusion cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** S, M (a stamp carved like the mark left by your calling card)
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a corpse and mark it with a magical mark. You can choose to make it a visible mark that appears as a rune or word written on the flesh, or you can choose to make it an invisible mark. Creatures who specifically examine a corpse for a calling card automatically detect one, whether visible or invisible.
