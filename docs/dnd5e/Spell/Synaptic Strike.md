#Spell
*2nd-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, M (a weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon strikes with mind altering magic, and the attack deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage to the target.

Additionally, the target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or have muddled thoughts until the spell ends. During that time, whenever the target makes an attack roll, ability check, or Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, the target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the roll.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
