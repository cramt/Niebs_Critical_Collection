#Spell
*4th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon shatters the ambient magic surrounding the creature, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 force damage. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, that concentration is broken.

In addition, any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spells’ level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
