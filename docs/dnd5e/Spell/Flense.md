#Spell
*8th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 ft. 
**Components:** V, S, M (a scalpel)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You target a creature you can see within range, using necromantic force to slice the skin from its body. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 necrotic damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to force the same target to make another Constitution saving throw and repeat the damage. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spellâ€™s range, if the target is reduced to 0 hp, or if it has total cover from you.
