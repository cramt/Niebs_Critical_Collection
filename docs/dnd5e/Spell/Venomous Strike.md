You coat your weapon with toxic poison. The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the attack deals an extra 1d6 poison damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the spell ends.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
