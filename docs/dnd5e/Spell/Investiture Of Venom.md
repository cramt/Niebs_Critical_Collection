Until the spell ends, your veins bulge and become visibly green beneath your skin, your eyes weep constantly with liquid poison, and you gain the following benefits:
* You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
* You can use a bonus action on your turn and choose a creature within 30 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature loses any resistance or immunity it has to poison damage or the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.
* When you choose a creature you can see within 30 feet, you know if it has poison resistance or immunity, as well as if it is immune to the poisoned condition.
* You can use your action to launch a geyser of toxins in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.
