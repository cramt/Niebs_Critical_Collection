#Spell
*3rd-level evocation (Sangromancy)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a melange of wilted daisies and other herbal powders worth at least 300 gp, which this spell consumes)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of casting this spell you must expend three hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, you can touch a creature who has died within the last 10 minutes and return it to life with 1 hit point. In addition, roll the hit dice you expended casting this spell, and the creature gains temporary hit points equal to the result.

At the start of each of the target creature’s turns, it loses 1 temporary hit point granted by this spell. While the creature has any temporary hit points granted by this spell it moves with unnatural vigor, gaining a +2 bonus to all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Once it loses all remaining temporary hit points granted by this spell, the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

This spell can’t return to life a creature who has died of old age, nor can it restore missing body parts.
