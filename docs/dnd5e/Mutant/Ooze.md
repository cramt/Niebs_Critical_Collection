#Mutant
***Your natural state is an amorphous collection of flesh or slime. Whether you were born this way or were somehow made this way no longer matters because now all that matters is your urge to consume.***

***You learn ways of utilizing your amorphous body to seep into cracks where you don't belong.***

### Liquid Body
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth.

Additionally, your body can flow like honey. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on attempts to escape being grappled. Doing this will reveal your true form.

### Rapid Consumer
Starting at 6th level your body becomes naturally acidic. All of your Natural Weapons do acid damage.

### Unstemable Flow
By 10th level, your body becomes highly resilient. You gain resistance to acid damage.

Additionally, you are immune to being grappled by creates that are large or smaller in size.

### Boil
Starting at 14th level, you can use your Bonus Action begin foaming and bubbling for 1 minute.

For the duration, you are under the following effects:

* Your skin begins to bubble, and your body begins flowing faster. Your speed increases by 10 feet and you have advantage on grappling checks made to grapple hostile creatures.

* Additionally, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from non-magical sources.

Once you have used this ability you can not do so again until you have completed a long rest.
