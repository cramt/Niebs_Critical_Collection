#Mutant
***You have died before, but you were brought back by something out of your control. Perhaps you're now a shambling bundle of rotten flesh, nothing but a collection of bones, or perhaps you are a cobbled-together mess of stitched-together limbs from various sources.***

***Whatever returned to back to life, your body now seeps forbidden magic and terrifies those around you.***

### Expanded Spell List

### Shambler
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Intimidation, or Survival.

You also don't need to sleep. Instead, when you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

### Rotten to the Core
Starting at 6th level your touch drains those around you. All of your Natural Weapons do necrotic damage.

### Peer Into the Afterlife
By 10th level, you can utilize your connection with the afterlife in new ways. You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Speak With Dead\|Speak With Dead]] once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before being able to do so again.

You also gain resistance to necrotic damage.

### Unkillable
Starting at 14th level, you can use your Bonus Action to surge with necrotic energies for 1 minute.

For the duration, you are under the following effects:

* The smell of rot filled the air, and your eyes glow with a dark purple hue. If you have at least 1 hit point and are below half your maximum number of hit points, you gain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of your turn.

* You also gain immunity to necrotic damage.

Once you have used this ability you can not do so again until you have completed a long rest.
