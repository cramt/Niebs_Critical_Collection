#Mutant
***There are many specific catalysts that can be considered to stem from nature, but a few of the more common ones can be when a creature from the material plane gets lost in the wilderness of the Feywild for so long that they start to forget their own form, as either a reward or punishment from a nature deity or powerful spirit or as a part of great druidic rituals to create guardians for their sacred groves.***

***There are many paths through the forest, but whatever your path has been, it has led you to become a nature catalyst Mutant. Your form shifts towards a hybrid animal, as you mutate to manifest the various features of the beasts of the wild. Your claws will likely be like those of a great cat, your horns like those of a great elk, or your hide like the thick fur of a bear. Regardless of the exact mutations, you might manifest, and while they each individually come from nature itself, you yourself shift step by step towards becoming something brand new; a perfect predator, and the top of the food chain.***

### Apex Predator
Starting at 14th level, you can use your Bonus Action to become a form of a perfect predator for 1 minute.

For the duration, you are under the following effects:

* While in this form your appearance changes to be a bestial version of yourself, and your Natural Weapons gain a reach of 10 feet.

Once you have used this ability you can not do so again until you have completed a long rest.
