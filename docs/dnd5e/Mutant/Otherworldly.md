#Mutant
***For a Mutant with an otherworldly catalyst, life is a slow descent into the very strange, and often terrifying. Whether your catalyst was a reality-changing contagion from the Far Realms, a horrible curse, a deal with the devil gone wrong, or just having drunk an alchemical concoction that you probably shouldnâ€™t have, your body is mutating towards something, not of this world.***

### Expanded Spell List
Your otherworldly catalyst lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a mutant spell. The following spells are added to the shifter spell list for you.

||~ Otherwordly Expanded Spells |
|Spell Level |Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Armor Of Agathys\|Armor of Agathys]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Arms Of Hadar\|Arms of Hadar]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Darkness\|Darkness]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Silence\|Silence]] |

### From Beyond
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Deception, or Religion. You also learn either Deep Speech, Infernal, or Abyssal, depending on the exact nature of your mutations.

### Alien Mind
Starting at 6th level, your mind has changed enough that most mind-influencing abilities have a harder time affecting you, making you Proficient with Wisdom saving throws. If you roll a natural 20 on such a saving throw, the effect is instead reflected back at its source. It is best not to look too closely at the deeper recesses of your mind.

### Sight Beyond
At 10th level, the magic that is changing your body starts to become visible to your naked eye. You can cast [[dnd5e/Spell/Detect Magic\|detect magic]] at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Stuff of Nightmares
Starting at 14th level, you can use your Bonus Action to change into a shadowy monster for 1 minute.

For the duration, you are under the following effects:

* While in this form you turn into a demonic or generally monstrous version of yourself, hidden in darkness that seems to move with you and extends 10 feet in every direction around you.

* The first time any creature starts its turn within this darkness it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Mutant Save DC or become frightened of you until this ability ends.

* The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

* Any creature outside of this darkness also has disadvantage on any ranged attacks made against you.

Once you have used this ability you can not do so again until you have completed a long rest.
