#Mutant
***You are the product of a forbidden alchemical ritual or experiment. Whether it was done by you, someone else and whether or not it was intentional or not is up to you. Whatever happened to you, your body is now forever an amalgamation of chemicals and magic, ever-flowing and mutating.***

***You have gained limited control over the production of alchemical concoctions in your body, and utilize them with great effect.***
