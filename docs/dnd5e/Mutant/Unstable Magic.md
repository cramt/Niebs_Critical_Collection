#Mutant
***You were somehow affected by high levels of magic when you were young. Instead of infusing you with magical powers of your own, it instead made your body incredibly unstable.***

***Your body is very unstable and often changes rapidly, releasing some of the magical energies contained within you.***

### Expanded Spell List
Your unstable magic catalyst lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a mutant spell. The following spells are added to the shifter spell list for you.

||~ Unstable Magic Expanded Spells |
|Spell Level |Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | [[dnd5e/Spell/Chaos Bolt\|Chaos Bolt]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Chromatic Orb\|Chromatic Orb]] |
| 2nd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Aganazzars Scorcher\|Aganazzar's Scorcher]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Mirror Image\|Mirror Image]] |
| 3rd | [[dnd5e/Spell/Blink\|Blink]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Elemental Weapon\|Elemental Weapon]] |
| 4th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Elemental Bane\|Elemental Bane]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Greater Invisibility\|Greater Invisibility]] |
| 5th | [[dnd5e/Spell/Far Step\|Far Step]], [[dnd5e/Spell/Mislead\|Mislead]] |

### Chaotic Flesh
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Sleight of Hand.

Additionally, whenever you cast a spell that deals either Acid, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder damage, roll a d8. Depending on the roll, the damage type of the spell instead becomes the type equal to the number rolled on the Chaos Damage table.

||~ Chaos Damage |
|d8 |Damage Type |
|---|---|
| 1 | Acid |
| 2 | Cold |
| 3 | Fire |
| 4 | Force |
| 5 | Lightning |
| 6 | Poison |
| 7 | Psychic |
| 8 | Thunder |

### Impactful Chaos
Starting at 6th level, whenever you roll a 20 on the d20 with one of you Natural Weapons, roll a d8. The damage type of the attack becomes the type equal to the number rolled on the Chaos Damage table, instead of the attack's normal damage.

### Modicum of Control
By 10th level, you gain a small amount of control over the energy inside you. Whenever you would roll a d8 on the chaos table, you roll an additional d8 and pick which of the two numbers you rolled for your damage type on the Chaos Damage table.

### Surge
Starting at 14th level, you can use your Bonus Action to surge with unstable energy for 1 minute.

For the duration, you are under the following effects:

* Random bursts of energy spill out from your body, and your body seems to be on fire, frozen, electrified, and more, all at the same time. At the start of each of your turns, you gain immunity to a damage type equal to a number rolled on the Chaos Damage table until the start of your next turn.

* Additionally, you can replace the damage of your Natural Weapons with a damage type equal to a roll on the Chaos Damage table.

* Lastly, you can hover up to 5 above the ground, and use your movement to glide.

Once you have used this ability you can not do so again until you have completed a long rest.
