#Mutant
[[dnd5e/[toc\|]]]

### Mutations
If a mutation has Prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the mutation at the same time that you meet its Prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

All mutations can only be taken once unless otherwise stated.

What each individual mutation looks like is unique to each Mutant. When deciding how exactly each mutation manifests, do consider the character’s origin, and the cohesive theme across all of the mutations. Most importantly though, be creative and have fun with it, as this is a big part of what makes your Mutant your own.

###### Eyes of the Night
You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

###### Aquatic Adaptation
You manifest gills and grow webbing between your toes and fingers, and can now breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

###### Cricket’s Step
Your long jump is 30 feet and your high jump is up to 15 feet, without a running start. With a running start, both of these distances increase by 10 feet. Additionally, your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren’t wearing any armour.

###### Spider’s Grip
You gain a climb speed equal to your normal movement speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

###### Skittish
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
You start to adopt a more animal-like movement style in combat, staying light on your feet and quick to move, which allows you to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action.

###### Chameleon’s Cloak
***Prerequisite: 9th level***
Your skin can shift and change in colour to mimic your surroundings. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

###### Pounce
***Prerequisite: 7th level***
You can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

###### Feeding Frenzy
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
As you grow closer to the beast within you, it’s appetites grow stronger. As an action on your turn you can feast on the corpse of a fallen creature to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier + your Mutant level (minimum of 1).

Once you use this mutation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###### Elemental Infusion
***Prerequisite: 9th level***
Your catalyst source infuses your mutations with elemental powers, and you gain Resistance to either Fire, Cold, Lightning, Acid, or Poison damage (your choice).

This mutation can be taken multiple times, requiring a different element to be chosen each time.

###### Rapid Regeneration
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
Your flesh knits back together at an incredible speed. At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0) if you have at least 1 hit point.

###### Barbed Hide
At the start of your turn, deal 1d10 piercing damage to any creature grappling you, or which you are grappling.

###### Flexible Joints
Your bones can bend, and your limbs twist and contort in ways which would normally cause significant injury. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on attempts to escape being grappled.

###### Enhanced Adrenal Glands
***Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher***
As a bonus action, you can send your adrenal glands into overdrive, giving you advantage on all Strength checks for 1 minute. For the duration of this ability, your carrying and lifting capacity is doubled as well.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

###### Electric Organ
***Prerequisite: 3rd level***
Just like an electric eel, you build up an internal electrical current which you can discharge against an unsuspecting attacker. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deliver an electric shock to them, dealing lightning damage equal to your Constitution modifier.

###### Bloodthirsty
***Prerequisite: 14th level***
As you become more beast than a man you start to crave the thrill of the hunt, and of the kill. The first time each turn when you deal damage with one of your natural weapons to a creature which is missing any of its hit points, this damage is increased by 1d8.

###### Bone Plating
One or both of your arms are covered in hard bone plating, dull spikes, or a general calcite growth. This increases your Armor Class by +2, while you are not wearing armour or using a shield.

###### Breath Weapon
***Prerequisite: 3rd level***
You can use your action to exhale a 20 ft cone of an elemental type (fire, frost, lightning, or acid) as chosen when you first manifest this ability. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw, against your spell save dc. A creature takes 1d8 damage on a failed save, plus your Constitution modifier, or half as much on a successful save.

The damage of the breath weapon increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

###### Extra Appendage
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
You grow an extra arm, leg, tentacle, or some other limb somewhere on your body. While it makes you look even more unnatural, it does function as a normal limb.

###### Hunter's Eye
Your visions grow sharp and focused, or you grow a third eye somewhere on your face. You double your proficiency bonus in Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. If you have Darkvision the range of this is also extended by +30 feet.

###### Large Ears
Your hearing massively improves, or extra earholes now cover your body. You double your proficiency bonus in Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Additionally, you gain a basic form of sonar, in the form of Blindsense with a range of 15 feet.

###### Bloodhound
You sense of smell greatly improves. You double your proficiency bonus in Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Additionally, as you can smell danger looming, you have advantage on Initiative rolls.

###### Acid Blood
Upon taking damage from an attack you can use your Reaction to have acid blood splash from your wounds at the attacker. The attacker is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, against your Spell save DC. They take 2d8 acid damage on a failed save. The damage increases to 3d8 at 6th level, 4d8 at 11th level, and 5d8 at 16th level.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

###### Absorb Magic
***Prerequisite: 9th level***
The volatile and chaotic magic that is at work within you can have unusual effects on nearby magic. You have learned to exert a moderate amount of control over this. When a hostile creature within 10 feet of you casts a spell at you, you can use your reaction to absorb some of the spell, and suffer 3 points of damage per level of the spell. You then regain a number of stamina points equal to half the damage taken, rounded down.

The damage taken from this ability cannot be reduced in any way.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

###### Handwalk
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
You mutations truly have a mind of their own. As an action, you can detach or reattach one of your hands without suffering any negative effects.

While detached, your hand grows a singular eyeball and becomes a separate creature from you with its own statistics.

In combat, the hand shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

While your hand is within 100 feet of you, as an action, you can see through your hand’s eye until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

If the hand is reduced to 0 hit points while detached, it is destroyed and lost forever.

###### Multifaceted Mutations
***Prerequisite: 5th level***
After spending at least 1 minute observing a humanoid creature within 120 feet, you can attempt to change your appearance to match theirs. When disguised, you are considered to be under the effects of the [[dnd5e/Spell/Disguise Self\|Disguise Self]] spell, however any alterartions to your appearance can be felt if touched.

Additionally, if you have heard your target speak, you can attempt to mimic their voice. A creature that hears your mimicry can tell it's an immitation with a successful Wisdom (Insight) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC.
