#Gnome
***A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.***

### Gnome Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and most are expected to settle into adult life around the age of 40. They can live to 350 years on average, but it's not too uncommon for them to reach 500 years of age.

- **Alignment.** Gnomes are generally Good. Those who tend towards Law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend towards Chaos are often minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are light-hearted, and even the tricksters amongst them favor harmless pranks over vicious schemes.

- **Size.** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Gnome Cunning.** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves against magic.

- **Languages.** You can read, speak, and write Common and Gnomish.


#### Forest Gnome
Forest gnomes are creatures of nature far more than any of their cousins, and to those rare folks who meet them they can prove to be steadfast allies and delightful companions. They are the one of few gnomes inclined to wear beards and hair very long, and an older male is likely to have a beard that extends to within a few inches of the ground.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Natural Illusionist.** You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.

- **Speak with Small Beasts.** Through sound and gestures, you may communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts.

- **Wilderness Tracker.** Forest gnomes are protective of the places they live, and can tell when even a twig is out of place. You gain proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track a creature in forest, grassland, hill or jungle terrain.

#### Rock Gnome
Rock Gnomes are said to be the most adept at gemcutting of any gnomish race. The industry is pursued with good humor, songs, and bawdy stories to lighten the load, but the humor rarely interferes with the work. Rock Gnomes are also exceptional jewelers, producing fine works of intricate metal to decorate their clothes. Their skin ranges from tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be nearly any shade. Male Rock Gnomes prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. 

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Artificer's Lore.** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magical, alchemical, or technological items, you can add twice your proficiency bonus instead of any other proficiency bonus that may apply.

- **Tinker.** You have proficiency with artisan tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

**Clockwork Toy.** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

**Fire Starter.** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

**Music Box.** When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

At your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these. The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such effects.

- **Whateverâ€™s at Hand.** You have Proficiency with improvised weapons, and your damage die when striking with an improvised weapon becomes a d6, instead of a d4.


#### Svirfneblin, Deep Gnomes
Deep gnomes survive in domains that are populated by dangerous foes. The two most hated by the deep gnomes are the kuo-toa and the dark elves, who continually seek to drive these gnomes from territory they consider rightfully theirs. To escape from the threats of the underdark, Deep gnomes have developed many ways to stay hidden in the cavernous darkness. Their skin is rock-colored, most often brown or gray. Their eye color is always a shade of gray, sometimes so dark as to be almost black

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Superior Darkvision.** Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.

- **Stone Camouflage.** You have advantage on Dexterity (stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain.

- **Mask of the Deep.** You can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Disquise\|self disguise self]] spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a short or long rest. If you are in direct sunlight, enemies have advantage on rolls made to see through your disguise. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

- **Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write Undercommon. 

#### River Gnome
River gnomes are cousins of forest gnomes who reside in the fresh waters of the realms. Singing behind a waterfall, or drifting lazily downriver, these gnomes can be seen from a distance laughing and being merry, but when approached by an outsider these gnomes are quick to jump into the river and swim swiftly away. These gnomes form a close bond with animals and wildlife that live in their river. They are defenders of the waters, and will show bravery and ferocity far beyond their size when the river they call their home is threatened.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

- **Speak with River Beasts.** Through sounds, simple gestures, and patterns of bubbles, you can communicate simple ideas with medium or smaller beasts that naturally have a swimming speed.

- **Swift Swimmer.** You gain a swimming speed of 25 feet. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to twice your Constitution score.

- **Aquabatics.** You have advantage on acrobatics and stealth checks made while submerged. 

#### Whisper Gnome
Whisper gnomes may look much like common gnomes, but these gnomes are quiet, suspicious sorts who have a limited control over sound and silence, using it mostly to communicate. Wherever they are found, whisper gnomes are
seen by others as spies, informants and recluses. Whisper gnomes are skinny, almost gaunt creatures, and their skin ranges in color from light gray to light green, with dark brown or black hair.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity or Charisma score increases by 1.

- **Gnomish Whisper.** Your mastery of gnomish whispering makes you able to silently communicate. You know the message cantrip, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

- **Whisper Magic.** Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Silence\|silence]] spell centered on yourself once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell
