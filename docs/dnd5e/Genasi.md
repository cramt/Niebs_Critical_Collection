#Genasi
***Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.***

### Genasi Features
- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

- **Age.** Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.

- **Alignment.** Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.

- **Size.** Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.

#### Air Genasi (Revised)
Quick of speech and of gait, Air Genasi are prone to flights of fancy and rapid changes in mood. They drift from one emotion to the next, though most have an ever-present air of carelessness about them. Air Genasi don’t form strong attachments, at least not without great reason, and as a result they are seen as loners and drifters. Likewise, Air Genasi are among the most adaptive, and they can take whatever comes their way with aplomb.

- **Unending Breath.** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.

- **Mingle with the Wind.** You know the [[dnd5e/Spell/Gust\|gust]] cantrip and can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Levitate\|levitate]] spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

- **Wind Strike.** Whenever you make a melee attack, as a bonus action you can use the [[dnd5e/Spell/Gust\|gust]] cantrip against the target of your melee attack, sending out a wave of magical wind with your strike.

- **Airborne Leap.** Your long jump is up to 30 feet and your high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start. In addition, you may fall from heights of up to 50 feet without taking damage.

#### Earth Genasi (Revised)
Earth Genasi are stubborn and immovable, proud and confident, and sometimes this spills over into vanity. They are strong like mountains and they know it. Of all the genasi elemental manifestations, Earth Genasi come the closest to possessing patience and engaging in true contemplation. However, the true strength of all Earth Genasi becomes clear when anyone tries to push them in a direction they do not want to go. When this happens, Earth Genasi resist with the might of the stone and the earth, and they knock down anyone that stands in the way.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1.

- **Earth Walk.** You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Fire Genasi (Revised)
Of all the genasi manifestations, Fire Genasi are the most aggressive, most impulsive, and the easiest to anger. They are also the most in tune with the raw power of their elemental heritage. Fire genasi feel the raw energy at their fingertips and are among the most eager to use it. The tempers of firesoul genasi burn hot, but also burn out quickly, and once the heat of the moment has passed, they are just as likely to jump from rage to elation in a matter of seconds.

Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Burning Hands\|burning hands]] spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Storm Genasi
Wild and powerful as a sudden thunderstorm, Storm Genasi can be a terrible sight to behold, lashing out at those that trouble them, like a lightning strike that is accompanied by a roar of thunder. Storm Genasi in the grip of their own emotions can be extremely unpredictable, since once they reach the point of unleashing their rage, they will do so until their wrath has run its course.

- **Lightning Resistance.** Electric energy flows through your body without you being shocked. You have resistance to lightning damage.

Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[dnd5e/Spell/Witch Bolt\|witch bolt]] spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Water Genasi (Revised)
Water Genasi are strongly independent and determined to make their way on their own. Feeling close ties to rivers and oceans, they see themselves as possessing the same deep strength as those great bodies of water. Since they can live both on land and beneath the sea, unlike any of their kin, they feel empowered by the ability to determine their own path in life.
