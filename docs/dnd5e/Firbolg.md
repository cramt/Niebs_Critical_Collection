#### Bloodbear
Firbolgs who have an affinity with the spirit of the bloodbear have longer, shaggier hair than other firbolgs, and have somewhat sharper teeth. They are known for using their ability to transform into the shape of a fearsome beast to protect their clans and withstand savage battles. These brutal, and reckless firbolgs are the first in any clan to run into the fray.

**Bloodbear Transformation.** Once per long rest, when you are reduced below half your maximum hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to half your level. You also gain the features of a humanoid-bear hybrid for 10 minutes. Your hair thickens into dark fur, your teeth sharpen and your nails shift into powerful claws. You gain two natural weapons for the duration, your bite, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on hit, and your claws, which deal 1d6 piercing damage on hit. Your claws count as finesse weapons. You also gain a climb speed of 30 for the duration.

**Scent of Prey.** Bloodbear firbolgs can smell blood in the air like a wild beast. You may use your action to learn the direction of any beast or humanoid below half of its maximum HP within 5 miles. You have advantage on Survival checks made to track creatures whose direction you know. You can track a scent for one hour, or until a wind of a moderate speed disperses the trail.

Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Ghostraven
Gliding in from the darkness on spectral wings, firbolg ghostravens call down dark fates through their affinity with the raven spirits of the Shadowfell. While a firbolg ghostraven can fly in the darkness and it does so mostly to avoid dangerous enemies, terrain, and hazards. They are the informants, and wise sages of the clans.

**Ghostraven Transformation.** Once per long or short rest, while you are in dim light or darkness, as an action you may briefly become ghost-like until the end of your next turn, gaining a flying speed of 30 feet, and the ability to move through any creatures space. While in this form, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacking or casting a spell ends this effect early.

**Curse of the Raven.** Once per long rest, as an action you summon raven spirits to distract one creature you can see within 30 feet, who must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed; weapon attacks against the target can score critical hits on rolls of 19–20, and the target takes an additional 1d6 necrotic damage from a critical hit. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself, and dissapating the spirits on a success. The save DC is equal to 8 + your Wisdom Modifier.

#### Primalstag
Primalstag firbolgs are proud warriors, leaders, and hunters who respect strength, endurance, forthrightness, and skill. They take part in and allow others to join in Wild Hunts, which often include the entire clan and a group of animals trained to defend the warriors of the clan. They are often seen wearing a headdress or helmet decorated with antlers to signify their affinity with the primal stag spirits.

**Stag's Leap.** You may use your bonus action to make a 10-foot standing long jump. Your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity while jumping in this way. You can use this feature up to three times, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Primal Reflex.** Your senses are sharp and your reflexes quick, allowing you to turn your opponent’s strikes into glancing blows. Whenever you take the dodge action on your turn and you are hit by a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from the Attack by a number equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
