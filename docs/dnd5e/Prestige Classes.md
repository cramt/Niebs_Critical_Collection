# What is are Prestige Classes?
A prestige class is a class that is built to be added on top of your existing character classes. Prestige Classes require specific in-game conditions to be met before you can opt into them. Often Prestige Classes are curses that have been inflicted upon, a blessing from a powerful being, or a set of tightly held secret techniques held by secretive organizations.

Whether or not you're allowed to either start a campaign with a Prestige Class or gain ranks in a Prestige Class in an ongoing campaign will always be up to the GM. A lot of these can be very disruptive to a party or a campaign's story.

# How To Use Prestige Classes
You gain ranks in a Prestige class when certain conditions are met as described in each Prestige Class, and the GM deems it appropriate. Some Prestige Classes grant you Boons as well as Flaws, giving you powerful abilities and debilitating downside respectively.

Each Prestige Class has 4 ranks in total, each rank giving its own options and abilities.
